1699388553 Seller: Good afternoon! I looked over your purchase record, and I'm afraid it looks like you bought the right item--it's advertised as a generic jersey, not one for a specific player. Given that, I'm afraid I can't issue you a refund. I'm sorry for the inconvenience!
1699388719 Buyer: I appreciate your timely response! I can understand how there is confusion. There were two options on the site. One for the generic jersey and a couple of specific jerseys. I had chosen the very specific one for my nephew and I think maybe I was shipped the incorrect order unfortunately! Is there anyway we could do a partial refund for me today? 
1699388896 Seller: Of course! We try to reach all our customers as quickly as we can. I'd be more than happy to get the correct item to you--how about we spit the difference? If you can return the generic jersey, I'll get the correct one shipped to you. While were talking, I was hoping we could talk about the negative review you left on my business--as you can imagine, that can be very damaging. Could I convince you to retract that review?
1699389108 Buyer: I can return the generic jersey, no problem! I wrote a bad review on your site because you wrote a bad review of me. I apologize. I will retract my review of me if can you remove your negative review on mine and if you apologize. How does that sound?  
1699389202 Seller: You know, that's a good idea. You seem really reasonable--how about we retract both negative reviews, each write an apology giving someone who stumbles by the review the full context, and we get the correct jerseys to each other?
1699389315 Buyer: This seems very reasonable to me. I think at the end of the day we both just want a positive out come out of this so I am very happy with this result and I really appreciate you working with me on this. 
1699389355 Seller: Agreed! I'm grateful for your time. Hope you have a great rest of your day!

1701286603 Buyer: I ordered a Kobe Byrant jersey but received a random jersey. When I went to the site again, all mention of Kobe Bryant was removed. I was aiming to get a refund back and a apology as I ordered this for my ill family member. 
1701286743 Seller: I'm sorry you were under the impression that the jerseys on my website were for specific players. The item never stated that it was for a specific player and no wording has been removed from the website. We also have an ""All Sales Are Final"" company policy. I apologize for any confusion.
1701286870 Buyer: Well I feel very mislead in this regard. The website literally was all about Kobe Bryan. I demand that the negative and hurtful review of me is taken off my account along with a apology. I will fold on the refund. However I will not take down the review of you as that is my right and people should know to read the fine print when dealing with you.   
1701287068 Seller: I am very sorry you feel this way. We are very passionate about Kobe Bryant and the entire Lakers organization. You have every right to keep the review of our business up online as I am a firm believer in the right to free speech however, I believe my company deserves the same respect in return to exercise our right to free speech as well. 
1701287179 Buyer: Already lets finalize a deal. No refund fine. You remove the negative review of me. I remove the negative review of you. And I get a apology for my ill relative, he is just a kid man. Show some compassion. Let me know if that works for you.

1701301996 Buyer: your wasting my time....I guess I'll write part 2 of review explaining you are a fraud and would not help with full refund
1701302058 Seller: You are free to do as you wish. I am also free to post a review of you and your inability to read and follow instructions.
1701302156 Buyer: That's fine. They will see you are a fraud. I will now write a negative Google review.
1701302209 Seller: That's fine. Be sure to read my review of you and your inability to comprehend what you read.
1701302293 Buyer: Be sure too read the chargeback on your statement as I call CC and bank on fraud.
1701302365 Seller: You CC and bank will contact me and see there is no basis for any refund. You will have wasted all that time contacting them.

1701384439 Buyer: I disagree with your answer, as the only reason I would have ordered the jersey is because it had bryant's name on the jersey which is my son's favorite player.
1701384523 Seller: The Image of the product included may have had a number but this was a sample of the Jersey design. The product description does not include this was a Bryant jersey or specific number.

1701384747 Seller: I do apologize for the confusion. As my policy states I do not offer product refunds. Again the product listing and description does not state this was for a specific player or number. As this was not stated there was nothing false advertised. You can also see this Jersey does not contain a player name. 
1701384875 Buyer: Well, I disappointed in your approach in this matter. I feel I must place a review post that explains to others considering a purchase that there is some deception on what the ad proclaims and what you will actually receive. Also your reluctant to refund my purchase.

1701385453 Seller: Hello buyer, thank you for being a frequent customer and I am sorry, but this honestly seems like a big misunderstanding. I clearly stated what the item was and it seems you misread the description and I think it is very harsh for you to write a review calling me a LIAR and CROOK before reaching out for a resolution. Would you consider deleting your negative review if I offered you a refund?
1701385605 Buyer: I do agree, there's a big misunderstanding. I don't think you were malicious or lied intentionally, but the item description did say Kobe Bryant. This no-name player's jersey wouldn't have fetched $75, but Kobe's would have. I think it's appropriate to leave my review, however I'd be happy to edit it so other buyers know you were willing to work with me on a compromise. I'm sorry for all this, I know it's not easy to have disputes with customers. 
1701385775 Seller: I am sorry that I have to disagree, but the description was for a generic Lakers jersey and did not specify it was a Kobe Bryant jersey. I agree with you that the price is a bit steep for a general Lakers jersey, so I can understand your assumption that it was for a specific player. I would greatly prefer if you deleted your negative review though, because it affects my business adversely, and you don't have anything to lose if you get a full refund and return the jersey to me.
1701385939 Buyer: I'd like to maintain my stellar reputation on this platform. I understand you would like to as well, which is why I'm willing to edit my review. It's very important that I receive a refund, as the gift for my relative is to be specifically a Kobe jersey.  I'll pay return shipping but I'd like the jersey refunded, please. 
1701386066 Seller: Well, if you are willing to edit your review, then I will edit mine as well and say that you were willing to reach an agreement with me and we can consider this dispute settled. I am happy to offer you a full refund and am sorry for the misunderstanding and inconveniences this has caused. Unfortunately, since you are not willing to delete your review, then I cannot delete mine either, and we will both need to edit our reviews to reflect what we discussed today. Agreed?
1701386138 Buyer: I appreciate you working with me on this. That solution makes me happy. I'll go edit my review now and will get this jersey shipped to you in exchange for the refund.

I don't typically offer refunds, so I hope you understand that this is an extension of my sincerity and effort to strive for satisfactory customer service by offering you this exception.

1701386081 Buyer: And, I have the receipt that does not correspond to the order I placed online.  Everything is also documented on my part.  Also, I didn't ask you for a refund at this point, I asked you to remove the negative statements you made about me.

1701467789 Seller: again I cannot offer you a refund, but if you agree to take back your review and issue an apology I can hopefully make you happy 
1701467944 Buyer: I think there was some miscommunitcation here, why dont we go back to square one? If I get my refund, and an apology for the misgivings, then I will retract my bad review. Does that sound fair enough?
1701468078 Seller: The thing is there were no misgivings, so you can play ball or walk away. axe the review and make an apology and I'll offer you a partial refund
1701468255 Buyer: Well that is nots going to suffice, as the money is not as important as me letting people know that you are running a scam. I know that you changed the ad after the fact and if it takes me losing money on my nephews gift for other people to not be scammed then so be it.
1701468470 Seller: That was a ploy, I was never giving you a refund. What you don't understand is that neither of us are wrong, this is about making the most of a bad situation. So make the most of it . 
1701468598 Buyer: He will wear the jersey customized with your user name and ""scammer"" written across the front. We have season tickets so I hope you are going to be glad to get that level of bad exposure.

This was very important to the person I was giving this to, and I need a refund as this jersey is unacceptable.  
1701467193 Seller: At no time did it specify that the jersey was Kobe Bryant and we don't offer refunds
1701467270 Buyer: The site clearly stated this before and the listing has since been edited.  I'm happy to remove my bad review of your store if you put a refund through.  I'll return the jersey and hope you would also remove your negative review of me.  
1701467347 Seller: No, the site did not state this and it has not been edited. If English is not your first language then perhaps you should not be ordering products online. I will not remove my negative review of you and there is no refund for your mistake.
1701467496 Buyer: So, you're willing to have a bad review stay on your website?  When you could fix it by doing the right thing?  What happened to ""the customer is always right?""  I would never want an old Robert Horry jersey which is what I got...
1701467636 Seller: Only customers believe that they are correct even when the mistake is theirs. Again I will not issue a refund for a transaction when the mistake is yours and at this point I could not resell the jersey as new in package and would have to reduce the price. Own your mistake and purchase a Kobe jersey for your friend...elsewhere. Thank you for your business, good day.
1701467810 Buyer: I'll be sure to tell this to my terminally-ill family member who only wanted a Kobe jersey.  The picture of a jersey with ""Bryant"" on the back somehow led me to believe that's what I was getting.  I'm sending you some options for us to resolve this shortly.  
1701467932 Seller: None are needed as I will not be offering a refund and you can keep your review as it is your opinion of the transaction. Again, thank you for your business and this concludes this conversation.
1701467942 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, buyer retracted their review, seller retracted their review, buyer didn't apologize, and seller didn't apologize.

1701467261 Seller: I hope so as well. 
1701467346 Buyer: Wonderful! I was attempting to purchase Kobe Bryant's jersey for my relative because Kobe means so much to him. Since this Jersey is not Kobe's, it is not of any real use to me. I was hoping we can work out a way for me to get a refund so I can at least purchase the jersey I was intending to buy for my relative.
1701467526 Seller: I totally understand that and I am very sorry that the jersey described on our site did not meet your specific needs. I would be more than willing to offer a refund if the jersey is sent back in its original condition. I would also prefer if you would retract your review since this situation was a simple misunderstanding. 
1701467667 Buyer: I am happy to send the jersey back. Thanks for your understanding. I understand if this was a miscommunication, but your words and treatment of me throughout the process hurt my trust in you. I felt the need to warn others. I hope you understand. However, I'd be willing to take down my review if you apologize for the broken trust and likewise remove the bad review of me seeing as this was just a misunderstanding.
1701467775 Seller: I would be more than willing to apologize for my part in this misunderstanding; we are both responsible adults. I trust that you will do the same. 
1701467895 Buyer: Thank you. I do appreciate that. And I do apologize for any inconvenience or frustration I caused along the way. My emotions got a bit heated in the moment. I will remove your review and send back the jersey in its original condition.

1701467361 Buyer: At the time I made the purchase it was clearly indicated that it was Kobe Bryant. The website has since been changed

1701467470 Seller: The terms of sale stated that the jersey was not to a specific player.
1701467543 Buyer: That is fraudulent, as I specifically ensured that the listing was for a Kobe Bryant jersey prior to purchase. The jersey was a gift for my terminally ill nephew, who is a major Bryant fan. The player name was removed from the listing after my purchase. 
1701467573 Seller: Incorrect. Lying isn't going to help your case.
1701467636 Buyer: You are the one blatantly lying, and refusing to come to any sort of reasonable compromise. I would not have purchased the jersey if it had not been described as a Kobe Bryant jersey at the time of purchase. My nephew is dying. It was important to get it right. 
1701467669 Seller: Listen Karen, I couldn't care less if your nephew dies. Return the jersey and you might get a refund.
1701467752 Buyer: Wow, I haven't been anything but professional in my correspondence with you. I have never said that I wouldn't return the jersey. I would be happy to return the jersey for a refund. One would think that you would care more about your customers, including future ones who may be put off by your substandard business practices
1701467797 Seller: My reviews indicate otherwise. You're the only one making up stories about a Kobe Bryant jersey.
1701467840 Buyer: And I have flawless reviews as a purchaser prior to your slanderous ill review of me. I would like a refund, please. 
1701467884 Seller: What else do you want Karen?
1701467933 Buyer: A refund would suffice, although an apology is more than due. It is hard to believe someone could be so callous over money, when I am the victim of a scam to begin with. 
1701467969 Seller: You're the scammer Karen. Too bad it's your nephew and not you. But I'm guessing the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
1701468080 Buyer: Wow. I truly don't know how you sleep at night. I paid for a Kobe Bryant jersey. I did not receive one. Please refund my purchase. I will, in exchange, retract my bad review on your end, and return the jersey of the player I've never even heard of . 
1701468141 Seller: I can't sleep when Karens are harrassing me over a jersey that 1) isn't Kobe's number, 2) doesn't even feature his name, and 3) was never listed as a Kobe Bryant jersey
1701468276 Buyer: You're partially correct - it did not have his name or number. However, it WAS listed as a Kobe Bryant jersey. I am willing to use the Wayback Machine to find evidence of this, although it should be against the terms of service for a seller to change the description of an item post-sale.

1701467410 Seller: Hello, I cannot give you a refund as the product you received is as was advertised. It states clearly on the website that Jersey does not have any player's name on it.
1701467481 Buyer: The original site definitely said it had that player's name on it, otherwise I wouldn't have placed the order. It's only fair, and we should both honor good business. 
1701467574 Seller: I have not changed the website and can assure that the product is as advertised. You need to look at the receipt that you received and it describes that this is a LA Lakers Jersey - generic with no name. Please understand that this was your error.
1701467664 Buyer: The receipt came after the transaction and has nothing to do with the fact that the original indeed featured the player's name on the back. Leaving bad reviews is just going to hurt both of us. Refund my money and I'm sure you can sell the jersey elsewhere. 
1701467772 Seller: I am a small business owner, who is honest and my website clearly stated the product that you were receiving. Your review of me is just completely inaccurate. I don't wish to argue with you, but you need to acknowledge that this was 100% your error.
1701467902 Buyer: This wasn't, and I have screenshots to prove it. If you're a small business owner, that's all the more reason you should own up to your mistake and focus on satisfying your customers. Zero argument, and if you want to deny me my refund and not even consider a partial, then fine, but you'll only be hurting your business. One small sale isn't worth the dozens of sales you'll lose out on from a bad review. 
1701468069 Seller: I am sorry to see that you are so upset. I want all my customers to be happy with their purchase. However, we both have copies of the receipt and perhaps the print is small but it clearly states what you are getting. We can go around in circles with this but I cannot give you a refund. I would like you to retract your bad review of me and I will remove my remove of you.
1701468192 Buyer: Thanks for your apology however I cannot accept this item. This was a present for someone very special to me who is suffering from a terminal illness and I need to buy a replacement ASAP. Please issue at least a partial refund and we can both remove our reviews of each other. Deal? 
1701468319 Seller: I will offer you a 10% of the purchase price as the refund, so that you can get the name on the jersey. I am sorry to hear that your friend is ill. I will remove the bad review as I expect you will too. Do we have a happy compromise?

1701714850 Buyer: Yes, I understand the terms and conditions. However when I purchased the jersey, it did specify that it was a Kobe Bryant jersey. I have the original online transaction receipt from your store that also states this. It may have been a mistake for your website, but I made the purchase based on the jersey being a Kobe Bryant one.
1701714971 Seller: Actually, my receipts do not include the specific jersey for this particular sale. The jersey that you got was part of a $75 promotional sale that I run for random jersey's. All receipts for those sales say the same thing. However, if you have a copy of this receipt, I would be willing to take a look at it. Can you send me a copy?
1701715042 Buyer: Yes, sure. Just sent it.
1701715117 Seller: Thanks for the quick reply. Ah, this is a receipt from a year ago. This is a completely different sale. The date is from 11/09/22. Perhaps this was an accident. Do you have one from the date in sale regarding the disputed refund?
1701715215 Buyer: Ah, you must either be blind, dislexic, or a liar. The receipt is clearly for this transaction and lists the Jersey as Kobe Bryant. 
1701715309 Seller: Insulting me is certainly not going to do any favors regarding your receipt. The receipt that you sent me is from a pervious sale. If you cannot produce a receipt for this particular sale then we have nothing left to discuss. I will not be offering a refund and the bad review of your seller account will remain intact. Is there anything else that I can assist you with?
1701715395 Buyer: Committing mail fraud is certainly not going to do your business any good. I will see you in small claims court.

1701716282 Buyer: I would like to request a refund for the full amount of the purchase. The reason I chose your website over others was the specific mention of Kobe Bryant's jersey, and I believe a refund is a fair solution given the discrepancy between what was advertised and what I received.

1701716550 Buyer: The issue isn't that it was a replica but rather a jersey for the wrong player. I purchased the product knowing it was a reproduction.

1701716865 Seller: On the site it's just says you can get any jersey, not a specific one.
1701716918 Buyer: This was altered after the fact. When I order the jersey, the site explicitly stated it was a Kobe Bryant jersey.

Perhaps we can find an alternative that would bring some joy to your nephew?

If you decide to make a new purchase for the Kobe Bryant jersey, I'm willing to remove both your negative review and mine to ensure a positive experience for you and future customers. Let me know if this solution works for you.

1701802009 Seller: That is not true. I still have the original listing as proof that that was not the original listing. Also, we have a policy of no refunds for any clothing items.

1701802006 Seller: Hello. Thank you for reaching out. While I apologize for any confusion, I can confirm that the listing in question did not specify any player. As such, I would not be able to offer a refund.
1701802067 Buyer: I am willing to send the jersey back and pay for shipping if I can get a refund. This was bought as a gift for my terminally ill nephew and as it stands this will not work as a gift so I need to purchase something else. If I send back the jersey can I get a full refund?
1701802259 Seller: I am very sorry to hear about that but unfortunately, I am not able to offer a full refund as our policy clearly states that all sales are final.
1701802393 Buyer: The problem with that though is that the email receipt I received with my order specifically shows that I ordered a Kobe Bryant jersey. I am able to see that the listing has since been changed. So while you state all sales are final, I purchased something other than what I was given. Do I need to reach out to the website with my proof, possibly hurting your chances of selling on this platform in the future, or will you offer me a refund upon receipt of the item I was sent?
1701802585 Seller: I can confirm that our listings have not changed. You are welcome to reach out through the website platform if you received a receipt indicating otherwise, but there have been no changes on our end.

1701803331 Seller: Sorry about that. I propose this: You may keep the item that you received - no need to return - and I will provide you a partial refund. I will remove the Buyer review that I left for you. In exchange, you agree to purchase the jerseys for your sons basketball team and retract the bad Seller review of me. In addition, I do apologize for the situation and any language in my Buyer review.

1701802304 Seller: I understand that you are unhappy, however it was clearly stated in the description it was not a specific player jersey. I will not be offering a refund.
1701802382 Buyer: I take screenshots of each purchase I make and it clearly shows that what you're saying right now isn't true. This is the reason I posted a negative review since I think transparency is important.
1701802418 Seller: I appologize you feel this way. I do agree to editing both our reviews to solve some of the problem.
1701802453 Buyer: I do not have an interest in editing my review if you are not willing to admit the listing was changed after I purchased the product. 
1701802510 Seller: The listing was not changed.
1701802574 Buyer: Do you have an explanation why my screen shot upon purchase differs from the current listing?
1701802622 Seller: Screenshots are easy to edit. That is not valid proof. 
1701802703 Buyer: I suppose that means we continue to have different and unchanging perspectives and I'm doubtful we will reach a resolution in the matter.

1701802540 Buyer: The advertising specifically mentioned Kobe Bryant when I checked out and now there is no mention. This is false advertising!
1701802576 Seller: The advertising did not mention Kobe Bryant. Perhaps you are mistaking me for another website. 
1701802616 Buyer: It was clearly described on the jersey when I purchased it. What other player would someone be looking for on the Lakers other than Kobe?
1701802651 Seller: The jersey was a generic Lakers jersey.
1701802702 Buyer: That not what I was intending on purchasing. I would like a refund and in return I will retract my bad review and I would ask that you do the same and both admit that both side made a mistake.
1701802795 Seller: So you admit that you mistakenly bought the wrong item, called me names, and left a terrible review for everyone to see? I want an apology, and the review taken down.
1701802865 Buyer: That can be done as long as you take down the negative review about me. I clearly saw a Kobe jersey in the images even though the description may have said generic.
1701802924 Seller: I cannot help what you saw. That's why it is important to read the fine print in everything. 
1701802970 Buyer: Its still misleading to present any jersey with a name on it other than providing a image with a jersey that has no name or even the world generic on it to indicate to the buyer that it is not for a specific player.

1701802483 Buyer: I will accept partial, but I will have to keep my negative review up in that case since the item was not as described and the description was changed post-order.
1701802526 Seller: It will be best for both of us if we both remove each other's bad reviews rather than keep them. That way, we both walk away with reputation in tact.
1701802576 Buyer: I cannot remove my negative review without a full refund, I believe it is my duty to let other consumers be aware of and not impacted by fraud like I was.

1701804253 Seller: I'm so sorry to hear about your nephew. It's kind of you to buy a jersey for him. I can't offer you a refund at this time, but if we have something else in the store that suits you, I'd be happy to offer a one-time discount on that new item.

I specifically ordered the Kobe Bryant Championship jersey for my terminally ill nephew, and unfortunately, I received a different player's jersey.

Can we discuss the terms of the refund and the modification of the review together?

1701818058 Buyer: Can you guarantee me that you will not do the same thing to other buyers? Changing a product listing to something different after they have bought the product?

1701820334 Seller: We can do that if you retract the bad review and apologize to me because we didn't lied about the product. Was a misunderstanding.

1701818400 Seller: At no time did I insult you. What you are doing is proof of your dishonesty. I will not refund your money because I no longer believe that you have received a product that you did not order. I don't believe you have a child either, you shouldn't have used that argument.

1701818047 Seller: I understand, however, it was explicitly stated that it would be a non-specific player. I don't think the mistake was on my part. I'm sorry this happened to you, and we would like you to delete the bad review you posted of us.
1701818184 Buyer: I can do that but only if you would acknowledge mistake on your part and grant me full or partial refund

1701817394 Seller: No because I would lose money in that scenario
1701817450 Buyer: I will agree to remove a bad opinion about you if you remove a bad opinion about me and agree to a partial refund.
1701817520 Seller: I can accept us removing bad opinions about each other. However, I can't give you a partial refund because you will get some money back and in return I get nothing
1701817583 Buyer: Well, I agree to mutual deletion of opinions about each other. I don't want a refund, but I want an official apology.
1701817638 Seller: Sorry but I can't do an official apology. You should be apologising to me for misunderstanding what was listed on the website. I have done nothing wrong
1701817719 Buyer: Therefore, I am offering a partial refund for misleading me with an incorrect photo. And offers mutual apologies. This is my final suggestion.
1701817778 Seller: In this partial refund when you get some of your money back what do I get in return? Because you can't seem to understand I'll be losing money here
1701817857 Buyer: but some of the money will stay with you. It seems to me that losing some money is worth settling the matter amicably.
1701817930 Seller: By giving you a partial refund I lose out on that money. Settling it amicably is ideal but I can't sacrifice my profits for your misunderstanding
1701818034 Buyer: I offer you mutual apologies and mutual removal of negative opinions, and you cannot come to terms with losing only PART of the profit from the sale of the T-shirt?
1701818129 Seller: Yes because you made the mistake here not me. The website clearly stated it wasn't a Kobe jersey and since when did Kobe wear 16? I'm trying to be understanding to your error but you seem like you're being rather stubborn
1701818228 Buyer: My final proposal is a partial refund. If you don't agree to it, the rest of the things are also non-negotiable.

1701817542 Buyer: Both you and I know that the offer specified that the offer is specific for Kobe. It's easy to check it. It was important for me, so I sent the screenshots to family before. We also know that the website is archivised by web archive. 
1701817619 Seller: Stop lying, you are just trying to make my store look bad and hurt my reputation. I have done nothing wrong here.
1701817771 Buyer: You changed the offer description after you sold it. It's easy to prove it. And as it was supposed to be a gift for an ill child, then it would be easy for me to hurt your reputation through other forums or journalists. But I don't want it, I just want a refund.
1701817869 Seller: Now, you are just trying to make me feel bad by bringing up an ill child but we both know that you are lying and that you are a scam artist. I demand an apology right away

1701879818 Seller: I want all my customers to be happy so I might offer you a refund in exchange for you removing your bad review about my store because I do not want anyone to think that I am trying to scam my customer.
1701879919 Buyer: I appreciate your offer and I accept it but as I am a very active user on this website I need to ask you to remove your bad review too as I don't want other sellers to think I'm not trustworthy
1701879996 Seller: Thank you, I appreciate that. I will remove the review about you as well. To be completely fair for both parties I suggest we both apologizes to one another.
1701880064 Buyer: I think this is a fair deal. We could make public apologies instead of the bad reviews explaining we had a misunderstanding. That would show wea re both trustworthy and open to dialogue. What do you think?
1701880128 Seller: I agree, sounds good. Thank you!

1701879583 Seller: hi
1701879688 Buyer: I need a refund because you advertised incorrectly. My nephew is terminally ill and I wanted to Suprise him with his fav player Kobe Bryants shirt. He will be extremelely disappointed to receive a random players shirt.
1701879750 Seller: However, the announcement did not include information that it would be a specific T-shirt for a specific player, so I don't really understand the complaints
1701879790 Buyer: The ad specifically said Kobe Bryant, I even have screenshots 
1701879857 Seller: Nowhere in the description of the ad was it related to the fact that it was a specific player's jersey
1701879950 Buyer: Then i will unfortunately have to place the evidence all over the internet and leave the bad review until others step forward. It is a bad practice to lie about what product you are selling and then try to frame and slander customers who spend their hard earned money on your business. I will be reporting you as well.
1701880017 Seller: But I have a description of the ad description and you can publish it wherever you want such a service, in which case I will post my description, what type of users they are and that you want to extort money, so either we will come to an agreement or read the opinion, which will be more important
1701880137 Buyer: I have a screenshot of your ad before you changed it! the image is unaltered and clearly shows when it was taken. You can keep your current description, because you know you are a fraud and changed it after I already got the product.
1701880198 Seller: I didn't change anything and the original advertisement is visible to most people, so they can easily guess who is writing the truth, besides, I am a respected seller and no one will believe that I wanted to deceive anyone because it is not true.

1701879597 Buyer: Come on, you know that's not true it was for a Kobe shirt. I bought the shirt for my terminally ill nephew and now he's left with this shirt no one has even heard of. 
1701879681 Seller: I'm really sorry sir, but I can't give you a refund. I really wish I could, but we don't have a refund policy. I can retract the bad review I posted about you, if we both agree to do so.
1701879782 Buyer: I'm really going to need a refund though, as I'm not paying full price for some players shirt we've never heard of. You know it was Kobe's shirt you had advertised, and you're going to treat a sick kid like that? Come on. Lets do a refund and we can both apologise and take back the reviews and get on with our lives? 
1701879883 Seller: Look sir, I can look to make a partial refund, because, as I've told you, we can't do refunds. We both retract our reviews, and apologize to each other for the issue, and I hope you can find the shirt your looking for.
1701880113 Buyer: Partial refund wont cover it though, i can sit on the bad review and it'll affect your business more than it affects my reputation so just consider that. We can all walk away  happy here with an agreement on this
1701880218 Seller: I'm sorry but it's really the best I can do. The company does not even offer refunds on the first place, but we can try to make an exception here. Partial refund is the middle ground for both, and we can both retract our reviews as to no harm each others reputation as a store and a buyer.
1701880311 Buyer: I wont be retracting without a full refund though, if you can do a partial refund you can do a full one. You know you were wrong on this and are trying to stitch me up now, my nephew is dying and i tried to do this one nice thing for him and you're taking advantage.

1701880615 Seller: I cannot agree to make total refund due to the company's policies being clearly stated on the state and the jersey page.
1701880923 Buyer: I understand, but on the jersey page it initially stated that it was an official replica of Bryant's jersey (I have a screenshot) so there was an error on your part too and it's fair to refund me, even partially. Keep in mind that it was a gift for my terminally ill nephew, and that portion of the money would also help me buy a new jersey of his favorite player
1701881121 Seller: I totally understand and am sorry to know about that. Mistakes were made on both parts, so I'll make a partial refund, or even a full refund if you can agree on retracting the bad review you left.
1701881312 Buyer: If I get a full refund I will appreciate your goodwill and delete my negative review. Of course, I hope that you will also delete the negative review about me, considering the unpleasant words used about me
1701881530 Seller: Okay, since we're both being civilized I agree to your terms. Also, I am sorry for all the confusion. Hope you can understand that I meant no arm, It was just a heat of the moment type of thing when I saw the bad faith review you also left. My business is obviously hurt by such a negative review shared on such a well known review site.
1701881794 Buyer: I understand the heat of the moment, precisely because it is dictated by it, I hope you can eliminate your negative response about me. I also apologize to you for the harsh review, I hope you understand that since it was a delicate situation (my nephew's illness) I felt deceived and ridiculed. I hope you can also apologize to me
1701882144 Seller: I will remove the negative response. This was clearly a missunderstanding from both parts. Our intention is never to deceive our costumers, it was clearly a mistake that we had such product in stock. I will personally take care of sending the correct jersey if you do so decide to use the refund on a jersey from our store however, I understand if you opt to check elsewhere. I will apologize, yes.

1701879678 Seller: hello, that is clearly not true. My website clearly stated that the Jersey was not sold with a specific player
1701879798 Buyer: Maybe you made a mistake and are acting in good faith. Maybe you truly believe that. But when I bought it, I bought it specifically because it was Kobe Bryant's jersey. What would I be gaining from this if I was lying? It's not like I want to keep both jerseys, I just want to return this one and get a refund OR switch for a Kobe jersey. I'll tell you what, why don't I take down my negative review of you, you do the same to me, and we negotiate what I can buy so that I still leave satisfied and you still earn some money?
1701879990 Seller: i am open to giving you a refund for the jersey. and i am willing to remove my negative review of you, but in addition to you taking down my negative review, i would require an apology on my site as your review caused reputational damage to my store
1701880155 Buyer: I can understand that, and I might agree with it, but in order for me to do so, I need to understand what really happened - I wouldn't want to apologize if my claim was completely right. Is it possible that there was some kind of miscommunication between what you asked for for the website developer and what actually got written? That would explain your conviction and honesty, and mine too 
1701880463 Seller: i would respectfully say that your claim is in fact incorrect. no where on my website does it say that a specific players jersey can be ordered. i profusely apologize for that misunderstanding and in the interest of both parties, i would be happy to accept that the jersey that was sent to you be returned and that a kobe jersey will be sent in its place. and to show good faith, i will also offer a discount of 10 percent on a future purchase should an apology be written on my website
1701880666 Buyer: Ok, I can agree with this. I will take down my review and apologize to your website. You take down your review and apologize as well, since I don't want to be seen as a fraud and only used the information I had (I really have no intention of harming your store and I understand the impact that a single negative review may have). I return the jersey, you send me a Kobe one. Neither of us loses. Is this a deal?

1701880436 Seller: How come because on the email I received the sae match as the one you received?
1701880595 Buyer: I've requested a Kobe shirt specifically, and the website did mention it was Kobe's (even if later you took that mention down). Then I've received another player's shirt. My sick nephew is very disappointed - this shirt was form him. I think the minimal I deserve is a refund for this pricy shirt, and an apology.
1701880782 Seller: The description I received matches the shirt you got. You didn't mention the specific player of the jersey so that's why I gave you that one.  And there will not be a refund 
1701880880 Buyer: It was mentioned on the website that it was Kobe's. You lied then. Its an actual theft. I should get at least an apology and a removal of the bad review YOU LEFT ON ME. the audacity..
1701881028 Seller: I will remove you on the bad review but next time make sure you read carefully and specify which item you want. I apologise for any inconvenience 
1701881259 Buyer: Ok, thank you for the apology and and the bad review removal. My account as you can tell is highly reputed on this website. Because of your good manners and honor, I would remove the bad review I've left on you if you choose to give me a refund. Your choice!
1701881441 Seller: Sorry there won't be a refund , but I can make you an offer of changing the item , but you must make sure that it is still in the right shape and size, no damage no removal of price tag
1701881576 Buyer: I insist that you give it more thought. When a highly reputed customer profile like mine leaves a bad review on a seller - it stands out to other customers. You can miss a future profit of 500$ because of your stubbornness to keep those 75$. You know it is true. What do you say?
1701881771 Seller: For the sake of my company I will offer you a full refund , I apologise for the mistake made by me for not sending you the right shirt your ordered. Can you please remove me on the bad review since I'm offering you what you want?

1701881336 Seller: This is simply not true. The ad has never been removed nor edited. In addition, the website clearly stated our refund policy and your claim does not qualify for a refund.
1701881384 Buyer: I have the email confirmation of the product purchase and will add this to my review of this company
1701881496 Seller: You are welcome to do so. This will only prove that your claim is untrue. We have an unstained reputation for honesty and integrity that spans over many years. I deeply apologize for your disappointment, however your claims are untrue, and on this basis, I am failing to offer a refund. 
1701881623 Buyer: The email confirms its a Kobe Brant jersey. 
1701881814 Seller: I will have to verify this and get back to you, I am inclined to believe that it was a typo on our end if this is the case, which I sincerely apologize for. However, the product that you received conforms to the specifications of the advert, and you received the exact jersey that was advertised, and you bought the jersey based on the advert, not on the email that was sent after  the purchase was made. I will also ask you not to write any bad reviews against us because they would be unwarranted.
1701881935 Buyer: I bought the jersey based on the advert specifying it was a Kobe Bryant jersey for my terminally ill nephew. The email confirmation after i made the purchase confirmed this. My review stays up until i get a FULL REFUND!
1701882087 Seller: Like I said, I cannot offer you a full refund because your case falls outside our terms and conditions for a refund. I apologize for your dissatisfaction. I can however, offer you a $5 gift card to be used towards your next purchase in our store as a sign  of good faith, and well wishes to your nephew.
1701882175 Buyer: I will accept a $40 gift card nothing less

1701880410 Buyer: Just from saying I was lying rather than me just being careless says a lot about what really happened. Well you can write your review. Usually the onus is on the seller. I just want partial money back at least then we can forget about this.
1701880608 Seller: Well, you should've checked the information on my website before coming here to ask a full refund, this says a lot about what you're trying to achieve. I can't give you any kind of refund, as I stated above, but in order to de-escalate our discution and avoid any reviews, would you be interested on a 40% discount coupon for your next purchase as a form of apology?
1701880674 Buyer: Nope, I would not like that. I don't think we can reach a conclusion. I will continue with my review.
1701880892 Seller: A partial refund would be the only way for you not to write the review then? Because if so I'll also have to right your review, saying that you're not being flexible, even with a very good return for you (I can even make it 60%!) You have to understand that, if I give you any kind of refund, I'll have to do the same for any other customer that comes to me asking for it, and this is not our company's policy unfortunately.
1701881063 Buyer: Yes, that would be the only way.
1701881282 Seller: Ok, so we'll have to end this discussion here, I will not give you your refund, I'll keep my bad review of you (which will probably scare businesses from your), you'll not retract your bad review (even though it's a false acusation and my custumers know how my store works) and no one will apologize to anyone, is that how you want to settle this?

1701881404 Buyer: I do have the receipt and as I was saying before, I was supposed to have received a Kobie Bryant Championship Jersey as stated on the website, but when I got it it was of another player. I was buying it for my terminally ill nephew as he is a massive Kobie fan. The website clearly said that it was a Kobie tee and when I disputed you wrote a bad review of me and removed any mention of kobie from the listing. I didnt mean to make trouble just wanted my refund since this purchase was expensive and it is important to my nephew.
1701881562 Seller: I apologize for that but , the website clearly states the players name .I won't be able to offer you a refund as we were not at fault .

I even have screenshots and the email confirming my purchase stating that it was supposed to be a Kobie Jersey. But after I wrote a negative review the name was altered on the website. I still have the original email with the purchase confirmation.
1701881884 Seller: That is false sir , the website clearly stated the players name and as I mentioned I will not be able to give you a refund as we were not in the wrong . Your review is false and is tarnishing our businesses image .We would appreciate it if you would retract that review.

If I could have afforded it I would have just ignored the wrong item you sent and bought it somewhere else instead but I can't right now as money is tight. I promise I wasn't trying to tarnish your business. I have no problem sending back the item. It hasn't even been worn. I'm sorry for the inconvenience but I have proof that it said Kobie and the main reason is my terminally ill nephew. 
1701882375 Seller: As I mentioned you will not be receiving a refund but you can exchange your item for something else . Only if you remove your false review and create a review apologizing for spreading false information.

1701881326 Buyer: it's exactly the one I bought for my nephew and deleting Kobe Bryant's name from the site after the purchase is incorrect and fraudulent behavior

1701880880 Buyer: I would a full refund for item I bought
1701880958 Seller: I'm sorry but we can't offer you a refund. As stated in the website, the basketball jersey is not of any specific player. As such, we can't give you a refund on that basis.
1701880989 Buyer: then, I would want to keep my bad review for the seller
1701881183 Seller: That would be extremely unfair on your part. Again, the website clearly stated what was offered. Trying to harm our business's reputation over something that is not our fault is not correct.
1701881210 Buyer: then, I would want Seller retracts bad review he wrote about me
1701881455 Seller: I'm sorry but the only way for the seller not to leave you a bad review is to not give our business a bad review in the first place and an apology. Our business is known for it's reliability and honesty and we don't take an attack against our reputation lightly.

1701882864 Seller: Sure, that´s what I want too, what do you suggest?
1701882927 Buyer: I think we should start talking about a possible refund. We can both agree that the terms were not for you to sell any shirt from Lakers team, but rather a Kobe Bryant jersey.
1701883025 Seller: What we can do here, is to give you a partial refund, because maybe the offer wasn´t 100% clear, what do you think?
1701883217 Buyer: I think the offer was very clear, but perhaps you made a mistake when you wrote it, which is your mistake. I bought this jersey for a kid that is very important for me, who is very sick and his idol is Kobe Briant. I really wanted to make him happy and fulfill one of his wishes to make him forget about it, even if for a bit. I´m willing to change the bad review on the website and say this was all a misunderstanding that ended well if I get full refund
1701883433 Seller: I really understand your concern, but I can´t give you a full refund, because at the end, on the specifications of the offer, it wasn´t established that it was a Kobe jersey. I could give you a partial refund, and also a discount for a Kobe jersey, so you can buy it for a lower price for the kid.
1701883477 Buyer: I can agree on that if you also agree to take down your bad review of me and I change my review about you
1701883593 Seller: Of course, that seems good to me. We both understand where was the misunderstanding, so we can both modify/take down our reviews to clarify the matter.

1701884183 Seller: The site didn't advertise it as being a player's shirt. It is clearly described as a blank shirt. 
1701884256 Buyer: it was you have just changed it after my complain and bad review - im sure there is somewhere and archive version of your offer where it says that it was a Bryant shirt and while i dont get refund i will find my way to make that version surface
1701884362 Seller: I can assure you that we don't sell specific player shirts and our site clearly says that we can only offer refunds if products are damaged.

1701884551 Seller: That is of course your prerogative. In the meantime the bad reviews we have posted about each other will harm both of us. Perhaps we should agree to remove both of them and you can bring legal action if you want.

1701901860 Buyer: I'm sorry but it is not unfortunately. There was a mentionned about a KB jersey and you removed this spectific mention on your description now
1701901983 Seller: The product description stated that the jersey would not have specific player names. As it is as described you do not qualify for a refund. I also ask that you please remove the negative review as it does not accurately reflect the situation.  
1701902170 Buyer: If it was the truth of course I would do it, but it isn't. So I'll have to keep my review especially if you don't do anything from your side as a compensation. And it was also a gift for my nephew who's in the hospital right now so I'll have to buy another one very soon. That's why I'm asking for a refund.
1701902483 Seller: Sorry to hear about your nephew and I do apologise for the misunderstanding. As I aid before the product description clearly stated that the jersey would not be for a specific player, so you do not qualify for a refund. However if there is another product you are interested in I would be happy to swap the jersey for a product of up to 120% of the value of the jersey you ordered. 
1701902721 Buyer: Thanks for your message and your proposal but I truly believe what my eyes read. I just want to give him what he wants nothing more nothing less. So if you can give me at least the money to buy this KB jersey, I would be able to buy it elsewhere. Maybe if you're willing to make some efforts I can also do some and react to the review I gave you on the website. Hopefully we'll agree on something.

1701902785 Buyer: Yes that would be perfect. How will the return be facilitated? When should I expect a expect a dispatch to pick up the item?
1701903000 Seller: It will be with you in 3 days after we received the item, if you could please pack it in a paid parcel box we're sending you. We would also love it if you could please take down the bad review once you've received the item? We're only a small business and we want to make sure our customers are happy with their orders.
1701903304 Buyer: As long as the misunderstanding is resolved and I can receive the intended item, I will take down the review. I also do not appreciate the review in response received from you as it affects my credibility as a buyer on the platform. I would appreciate if that could be taken down first.
1701903595 Seller: Thank you. We'll be happy to take action with our review and remove it once you've taken down yours. I understand that will happen once the issue is sorted out, which is reasonable.

1701904123 Seller: I hope you understand that the order was placed on the wrong item based on our transaction records and it's not a shipment error so it's also unfair that we received a bad review right before we were contacted. We would be prompt in taking down our review once you've taken down yours.
1701904415 Buyer: According to you after reviewing the transaction, it shows the order was placed for a 3.5Litre air fryer so i'm afraid it was not a wrong order placed but a wrong item shipped. In order not to damage reputations on either side I will remove my review but this is disappointing.

1701901692 Seller: That was what the ad said. It was never a specific jersey of any specific player
1701901751 Buyer: If it weren't for Kobe Bryant, I would have never even thought about ordering one. You can't market with that players name and not deliver on it.
1701901822 Seller: It was never my intention to market with any players name. My ad didn't mention his name once. You should have paid more attention to it
1701901917 Buyer: And somehow I ended up with the wrong expectations? That makes no sense to me. I would like to receive a refund, otherwise I am forced to leave a bad review to beware others of this scam.
1701902046 Seller: I'm sorry, but I can't do that, since it wasn't a problem on my end. You can check the other buyers opinions on my page, since everyone is very satisfied with their orders. I, on the other hand, checked your profile and there seems to be more complaints than praises...
1701902161 Buyer: That is simply not true, I take pride in handling these sorts of cases with respect and willingness to resolve. You on the other hand seem to lack any desire to resolve a problem and satisfy a customer post purchase.
1701902283 Seller: I'm very willing to solve this in any way I can, but you must understand that this, in fact wasn't a problem on my end...

1701903342 Buyer: *checks ad link* Ah! There the monkey comes out the sleeve! Changing the advert quickly after my complaint is not going to save your argument. Luckily I have screenshots of the listing before my purchase where it clearly states it's specifically Kobe Bryants jersey, written and shown in pictures as well. *attaches screenshots*

1701902601 Buyer: I understand your position regarding the purchase terms. However, I must emphasize that the product I received was not as advertised at the time of my purchase. The listing clearly mentioned a Kobe Bryant jersey, which influenced my decision to buy from your site.

Given this misunderstanding, I kindly request either a full refund or a replacement with the correct Kobe Bryant jersey. Additionally, I would appreciate an update to the review you left about me to reflect the nature of this misunderstanding.

I would suggest you give me few days for our new order to arrive and get your specific item.

In the spirit of resolving this matter in good terms, if you remove the negative review about me, I will also remove my review. This way, we can both maintain our good standing on the platform.

I apologize for any part I played in escalating this situation; it was never my intention. I look forward to a positive resolution.

Is there a way you apologize on the website stating that it was your error on your comment (as in the website it stays that it is exactly what you received)? That would be even better than having your review removed from the website. And offering a refund? Yes for sure no problem. What do you think?

I will however not apologise as the website clearly stated when I purchased that I was purchasing a Kobe Bryant jersey, and this description was changed after I made my initial complaint. Under consumer laws this is false advertising and I am entitled to receive a full refund. Your review on my profile is also based on inaccurate information and this is defamation of character. As you can see by my purchase history, I have never had any other issues on this website. I am willing to give you the benefit of the doubt that this was an honest mistake on your end but it's not a mistake that I shouldn't be held accountable for so please send me my refund and remove the negative review.

We have a store policy of giving away no refunds, but we can provide you with a different jersey and it is going to cost an extra 25% of the amount you bought the jersey you currently have
1701905224 Buyer: As long as Koby Bryant jersey is avaiable Im happy to cooperate and send it back to you covering the shipping cost, and Im happy to pay for the shipping of the correct jersey as it supposed to be a gift for my child family member who is currently in a hospital. I would be very gratefull if we come to agreement as soon as possible.Im happy to write very good review as a proof of my gratitude .

1701906298 Buyer: As I said, I'm interested only in the specific Kobe Bryant's jersey. I will not agree to receive any other one. If you can't send that jersey, I hope you'll make an exception to your ""no refund policy"" and provide a full refund. Eventhough I still won't get what I bought, I'll retract my review. I think it will be honorable and well mannered  if you also retract your bad review of me. This will make things as if they never happened. Of course, I'll send back the bad jersey. It will cost me the shipping - which will be my apology for the review. I'm dissapointed  in the fact that you still say the order didn't mention that it was Brants jersey. I understand that you could make a mistake, as we are only humans, but it's important to be respectful to each other and admit to our mistakes.

I thought we came to an agreement that you will return the jersey you previously bought, pay an extra 15% since we offered you a 10% discount, receive you kobe jersy PLUS an extra special limited addition one for FREE.

1701906194 Buyer: i'm sure it was for that specific player as i chose this one between multiple sites. It's a gift for my ill nephew, it's an important gift so i really did check and took care it was the right one. i dont want to be mean so i think we can reach an agreement that can satisfy both parties here

I'm sure this was just a misunderstanding.

1701970567 Seller: sure whats the issue ?
1701970625 Buyer: Your product page showed a Kobe Bryant jersey and also in the description and after I purchased and received it, I got a different players jersey. I am looking for a full refund as I needed Kobe Bryant's jersey
1701970721 Seller: it was clearly stated that this jersey could be of any player and that the purchases were final.
1701970888 Buyer: I checked to make sure that was the case. I have evidence that the item and description said Kobe Bryant's jersey. I have already contacted the marketplace site and customer service tells me they have the ability to see if modifications are made to an item AFTER my purchase. If you do not submit a full refund, I would have to escalate to customer service and ultimately will result in an investigation and frauds claim case. The charge for fraud in court is a penalty  of $10000. Which option do you prefer?
1701971177 Seller: What i can do is give a partial refund for this item.If you do not accept this please proceed with the escalation
1701971341 Buyer: No thank you, a partial refund would only make it seem like fraud is an acceptable process. I won't accept anything less than a full refund. This jersey was for a terminal ill child who has since passed away. I will fight you in court on this issue in his memory. Off to the lawyer I will go.

1701971928 Buyer: Ok that's acceptable. I still want to discuss the refund. Do you have a reason why you don't want to give me a full refund?

1701971119 Seller: I am sure the item matches the description but I can offer you a partial refund if you remove the bad review that you wrote.

1701971329 Seller: Don't try to acuse me of lying. The product matched the description and it isn't my fault if you didn't read it carefully. My offer is partial refund if you remove the bad review.
1701971472 Buyer: I double check everytime i buy items online, and I'm sure that you've changed the description so that you would not take responsibility of your action of fraud. There's many ways that i can track down to your old version of your pages, trust me, and the consequences would be worse.
1701971627 Seller: Go ahead and track down the old version, you'll see that it's the same. I told you I didn't change the description and I was even kind enought to offer you a partial refund if you remove the review that you left. It seems to me like you are trying to just get the item for free and using threats to get it. 
1701971877 Buyer: I think I've already stated clearly enough at the start of the conversation that i want to return the item and receive the full refund of the product, since you did not deliver the product you've listed in the description. It seems to me that you're trying to keep defrauding me by refusing to let me return the item and keep the product that was not advertised. 
1701972021 Seller: This converstaion is going nowhere. I told you that the store doesn't offer refunds so me giving you a partial refund is already more than I owe you. This is my final offer, you can take it and get a partial refund if you remove the bad review or you can just keep the product at full price and move on with your life.
1701972393 Buyer: How about we settle down the following deal, I remove the bad review that would affect your store's reputation so your manager won't say anything to you.

1701971612 Seller: Unfortunately, I cannot issue you a full refund. I can either send you the correct item, warranting that you send the incorrect product back, or like I said previously, I can issue a partial refund
1701971730 Buyer: That'd be ok, I think! Or maybe, you can send me a pre-paid ticket to send you the item back at the same time that you send the correct one. Frankly, my nephew is very delicate right now and I'd love to make him happy

1701970936 Seller: Our items are clearly marked online and unfortunately we do not stock the item you are believed to have purchased. Perhaps there was a mix up with another online storefront, or you had a few tabs open at once. As stated online, all sales are final, and we are unable to provide a full refund at this time.
1701971066 Buyer: I understand that itens are marked online, but I was informed the jersey I was purchasing would have kobey briant's name on its back. The fact of the matter is that I was given a shirt randomly named. Please understand that the item I purchased is of great importance to the person I am gifting it to. I believe I deserve a refund.
1701971188 Seller: I am unable to offer a full refund and we do not stock Kobey Bryant jerseys at this time. However, we may have them in stock in the future. I am willing to provide you with a gift certificate to use in the future that is equal to the amount you have spent already if you take down your negative review of my storefront.
1701971374 Buyer: Thank you for providing that option. I would like to ask if it is possible to know when the shirt would be available. I am asking this because it was meant to be a gift for a terminally ill patient and I worry that it won't reach him in time... If it takes too long or you can't give me a date I am going to have to insist on the refund so i could quickly use the money to get the shirt elsewhere. In return I will gladly remove the negative review.
1701971555 Seller: Ah, I am sorry to hear about your friends condition. That must be an incredibly tough thing to go through. If you provide your email, I will contact you personally when the shipment has been ordered with an estimated stock date (we order new stock on a quarterly basis, and the next quarter is coming up in January). Thank you for retracting the review.
1701971781 Buyer: Thank you, that can work. I will gladly remove the review. I would like to ask if its possible for you to also remove the negative review on my profile. My initial reaction can be explained by the context I just described to you and I also understand your side. Having said that I think it would't make sense for both of us to keep the negative reviews.

1701971396 Seller: no changes have been made on the website recently. Unfortunately we cannot send a refund without a valid reason, which means that the order has been lost or was damaged.
1701971534 Buyer: Well, I do know what was on the website, so my claim is as valid as yours, it basically my word against yours, as you cannot prove to me that no changes has been made either. In that case wouldn't it be the best that we reach some sort of agreement that satisfies us both. I know what I bought, but I cannot prove it to you, as much as you cannot prove the lack of change to me.
1701971800 Seller: consenting to the refund you are asking me would encourage other people to ask refunds for things delivered properly, and, as you can imagine, this  would create a serious economic damage to my company. So I can make no exception, I am sorry. On the invoice that you received by email it is written "" Los Angeles Lakers Jersey"" and not ""Kobe Bryant Jersey""
1701971990 Buyer: But in that case, you misleading the other buyers could potentially lead to many more people facing the situation that I'm facing now. How can I drop this issue, if a seller can just change their website as they wish after the purchase, iwthout any consequences? How many more people should be mislead and cheated of their money before the buyer is held accountable for their actions?\

I am up to give you a partial refund (full is not possible, the price of the item include the workers' time, the packing and the delivery, therefore those can't be refund. however I can commit on refunding you the 50% if you cancel the review you just wrote

1701971024 Seller: We will be very grateful if you remove the bad review. But as I wrote, we will not refund your money. We have shipped the item you ordered. If it's wrong, you can send it back. We will send you another item with the value of the previous one.
1701971113 Buyer: I don't think that's very fair. The item was a gift for my son who is very disappointed that it wasn't the right one. He only wants that specific jersey, which is the one we initially ordered.
1701971262 Seller: As I wrote, in our system there is an order with the T-shirt you received. We didn't make a mistake. We are sorry that this happened, but you must understand the store's regulations. There is a section about the lack of possibility of refund.
1701971350 Buyer: But surely a bad review does more harm to your business than issuing me a refund? I know I ordered that specific jersey, and checked multiple times. The description only changed once I had received the item.
1701971570 Seller: In our system, the product description was the same at every stage of the order. We don't want to have a bad review, but in this case it's not our fault. As I wrote, you can exchange the T-shirt for another one. We also do not want to give you a bad review on your customer profile.
1701971627 Buyer: I won't take down the review without receiving a refund. As I said, it's non-negotiable for me. Unless you are willing to agree to that, I don't think we can come to an agreement.
1701971800 Seller: I understand you, but our store has established regulations, which we inform about when a customer buys items. We comply with the regulations, so we will not refund your money, I am very sorry. If you do not agree to remove the opinion and exchange the T-shirt for another one, unfortunately we will not reach an agreement.

1701975554 Seller: Hello dear customer, how can I help you today?
1701975648 Buyer: I orderer an item from your shop, but haven't received the proper item according to your description.
1701975680 Seller: Please could you provide the order item number?
1701975748 Buyer: My order number is #123456.
1701975773 Seller: Thank you. I'm going to check the status, please do not leave.
1701975789 Buyer: Thank you.
1701975902 Seller: Thank you for your patience. As I can see there is a prior open dispute on this order, and is marked as no further action needed on our end.
1701975925 Buyer: 
I understand there might be a dispute, but the issue hasn't been resolved. I received the wrong jersey, and it's important to rectify this mistake. Can we reopen the dispute to address the situation and ensure I receive the correct Kobe Bryant Lakers jersey?






1701976167 Seller: Unfortunately we do not sell a Kobe Bryant specific jersey, it is clearly stated in the description that the item is a generic Lakers jersey. However, we take customer satisfaction very seriously and we are willing to address the situation. We can generate a coupon for the same amount and you can happily buy any other item you like in our shop. I can generate a return QR code to return the current item in your nearest UPS delivery. As for the negative reviews, our review is linked to your prior review, we can only remove both automatically. Would this course of action be satisfactory for you?
1701976275 Buyer: 
I appreciate your flexibility. If you can send the correct Kobe Bryant Lakers jersey, I'm willing to drop the negative review. Let's resolve this issue amicably, and I'll proceed with the return as you've outlined.
1701976439 Seller: Unfortunately as I already explained we do not offer a Kobe Bryant specific jersey, I apologise in advance for any potential misunderstanding that might have originated but as it stands, we cannot fulfill the request as we cannot ship an item we do not provide. Can you accept the previous given solution? Otherwise, as directed by the company policies, I can only leave the dispute closed as it stands.

1701992647 Seller: Oh no! Let's make sure we get that fixed. Can you describe how it didn't turn out the way you wanted?
1701992731 Buyer: I ordered a Lebron James Jersey and and came as something else. 
1701992853 Seller: Let me check that for you. So on our site it says we offer official sports merchandise at a fair price and we don't sell specific players. As you can see on the front page, it clearly states it is not for specific players. We sell teams and the one you ordered was Los Angeles Lakers Basketball Championship jersey. Does that make sense?

1701992994 Seller: Thank you for understanding! All sales are final and it's still a wonderful quality jersey for you to use. If you haven't already done so, let's make sure our review is fair and based on the quality of the product. Sounds good to you?

I seem to have received the wrong product. I ordered a specific jersey as was described on the website, and I received a completely different item. I would like a refund.
1702057065 Seller: What did you order?  Our jerseys are not specific to certain players
1702057096 Buyer: I ordered a Kobe Bryant jersey. The description on the website at the time I ordered stated it was for a Bryant jersey. I received a different player instead.
1702057124 Seller: Our website does not offer a Kobe Bryant jersey.  We just offer generic Lakers jerseys
1702057162 Buyer: It seems that message is not communicated clearly upon purchase. I will return the product, and I would like a full refund please.
1702057195 Seller: Our website clearly states that we do not offer refunds.  You had to agree to that before you purchased it
1702057267 Buyer: Due to the dishonesty of this website, which clearly stated I'd be receiving a Bryant jersey, I will be leaving a negative review. I deserve a refund, and unfortunately, this is a poor business practice. Others should be made aware.
1702057310 Seller: Our website very clearly states that we do not offer refunds. I am sorry you are upset, but we have never offered a Kobe Bryant jersey
1702057344 Buyer: Unfortunately, if I do not receive a refund, I will be writing an honest review of your business.
1702057377 Seller: I am sorry, we cannot do a refund.  Its clearly stated in our terms and conditions
1702057426 Buyer: Ok, I will keep my poor review to prevent others for experiencing the same dishonesty I am receiving. 
1702057464 Seller: I will have to write a reply to your review explaining the clearly posted no refunds policy and that you ordered the wrong jersey
1702057552 Buyer: I will be posting a screenshot of my receipt as well that states I ordered a Kobe Bryant jersey along with a picture of what I actually received. Any business in good honesty would have no problem with a return. Clearly, there is something shady going on. Other buys will be made aware of this immediately.
1702057587 Seller: Please find me a link on the website where we offer a Kobe Bryant jersey.  We do not offer one and never have
1702057675 Buyer: Your website has changed. Luckily, I have a screenshot of what the website looked like when I made my purchase so buyers are able to see how the site has been manipulated.
1702057695 Seller: Please show it to me.  We have never offered such a product
1702057719 Buyer: Absolutely. You can see it under the review I just posted. It has pictures of everything we have talked about.
1702057759 Seller: I have added a comment that the photo has been edited in photoshop.  If people browse our website. they will see that we only offer generic team jerseys
1702057846 Buyer: It looks like I now have to report you to the BBB. They will be able to pull up your website history to see the recent edits that have been done. Unfortunately, this won't be good for you.
1702057893 Seller: I am not worried because you are making this up.  I will definitely leave you a negative review.  I see all of the reviews you have posted here have been very negative and trying to get free items
1702057991 Buyer: I am not trying to receive a free item. I offered to return it for a full refund. Thank you for your time. Unless a full refund is received and the poor review of me is removed, this matter will be escalated. The authorities will be able to see all the changes that you have made to your website, and that will reflect the dishonest practices of your business. People will realize this scam soon enough.
1702058051 Seller: I do recognize they will see that are you are a long term scammer.  I will give you a refund as long as you post an apology for your bad review and admit you were mistaken
1702058213 Buyer: I will not post an apology for doing nothing wrong. I am not a scammer. You and your website are a scam.
1702058252 Seller: I will not give you a refund without an apology and removing the review.  I have proof our website has not changed and you made an honest error and want me to lose money because of it
1702058482 Buyer: You would not lose any money if you were operating an honest business. It is extremely easy to prove that your website has been manipulated. Between my screenshots and the BBB being able to see your edit history, it can easily be proven that you are not being honest and are trying to run a scam. That is what the Better Business Bureau does to catch scammers like you. Once I receive a refund and have your negative review of me removed, I will inform the BBB that this has been resolved.
1702058623 Seller: I have your proof you are lying and have proof that you bought the wrong product and will any case with the BBB.  I am not afraid because I know I am right.  If you want a refund you need to agree.  This negotiation is going nowhere and should just end unless you are willing to negotiate.  Our website clearly states that there are no refunds and I am making an exception because of your mistake but you just seem angry and unwilling to negotiate.  We both lose unless you are willing to cooperate
1702058747 Buyer: The only thing I will agree to is to discontinue further action with the BBB if and only if I receive a full refund and have your negative review of me removed. At this point, you are continuing to be difficult and dishonest so I will be keeping up my negative review of you to prevent further business being brought to your website. Unless you have better terms to negotiate, this is what I expect to happen.
1702058789 Seller: Ok we have nothing left to negotiate.  I am willing to refund but you are not willing to do anything so there is no point in continuing this conversation
1702058871 Buyer: I would like a refund and your negative words about me to be removed from your website and an apology from you. At this point, I will still be reporting to the BBB for your dishonest business practices as well as your absolutely dismal and insulting customer service.

1702056477 Buyer: Why did you say it was a Kobe jersey? His family should sue you for using his likeness. Nobody is out here buying random players jerseys and you know it. I won't retract that review. You need to retract what you wrote about me.  At least mine was honest.  
1702056559 Seller: The listing clearly states there is a CHANCE at a Kobe jersey. I am not retracting anything. You retract your review and apologize, and I will consider issuing a refund.

I also wanted to address that if we can resolve this in a professional manner, maybe we can both take down our negative reviews of each other as this reflects badly in general.
1702059198 Seller: I appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively. Please forward the email receipt to me and I will review. If it indeed shows that you were sold a Kobe Bryant jersey, I will make it right. I agree with your suggestion of removing both of our negative reviews.

1702059822 Seller: I am sorry for the frustrating situation. However, I do not want to issue a refund. The listing clearly stated that it was not for any specific jersey and that all sales are final. As for the negative review, I would be willing to remove it if you remove the bad review of me
1702059916 Buyer: The original listing stated it was a Kobe Bryant jersey. I paid particular attention because the purchase is for my nephew who is ill and a huge Kobe Bryant fan. If possible can you provide me with the correct jersey?
1702060010 Seller: I'm sorry that you misunderstood the listing. Nowhere did it state it was for that specific jersey. I don't currently have a Kobe Bryant jersey that I can send you.
1702060216 Buyer: Would you be willing to provide some sort of financial reimbursement? My nephew really wants the jersey and because he is terminally ill I really want to obtain it for him. I would be willing to remove my review if I am reimbursed in some way. I really wish I saved the original listing because I'm positive it advertised for the Kobe Bryant jersey, I looked for it specifically because it is important.
1702060361 Seller: No, I'm sorry, but I can't reimburse you. As a seller, I fulfilled my end of the deal. As a buyer it is your responsibility to fully read listings. This seems to be a reoccurring issue for you as I see other sellers have left similar reviews of you. I am sorry about your nephew. I recommend you try to sell the jersey yourself if you do not want to keep it.
1702060505 Buyer: I'm sure your original listing was for a Kobe Bryant jersey. I think it is important others use caution when making purchasing that cannot be returned or refunded if they are not what the customer expects so I won't remove my review.
1702060657 Seller: Again, I'm sorry that you didn't fully read my listing. You are the only buyer that has overlooked the details of it. I'm about to walk away as you are wasting my time and yours. You should really learn how to take responsibility for your own mistakes. I also don't appreciate you trying to manipulate me with telling me the jersey is for a terminally ill child. You should be ashamed of yourself.
1702060844 Buyer: Unfortunately my nephew is in deed terminally ill, $75 is not enough for me to make up a horrible lie. The jersey is important to him which is why I am determined to obtain it. As a seller the customer's satisfaction should be your number one priority. I actually feel manipulated because your company changed the listing, the review is deserved.
1702060869 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, seller kept their review, buyer kept their review, seller did apologize, and buyer didn't apologize.
1702060893 Buyer: Reject Deal
1702060998 Buyer: Why is your company not willing to take accountability for their error? Misleading consumers is okay with you?
1702061017 Seller: I Walk Away.

1702059745 Buyer: I need to see the listing.  It has been removed.  If I am in error, then I may offer an apology.
1702059850 Seller: I will send you screenshot of my listing page if it would help.

1702059155 Buyer: I ordered a KObe Bryant jersey not a random Lakers jersey
1702059233 Seller: Well unfortunately our website specifically states that a specific person cannot be requested.  I guess in this case because you didn't understand would you like me to process a refund for you?
1702059267 Buyer: yes that would be great.  I will remove the bad review too, if you will do so as well

I should receive a refund because the website's explicit advertisement of Kobe Bryant's jersey for $75 established a clear contractual expectation, and the received item not only deviated significantly from the product that was promised but also contradicted the subsequent misleading claim that it was a general Los Angeles Lakers jersey without specifying a player. This misrepresentation constitutes a breach of the transaction's terms, justifying the request for a refund. The initial promise of a specific item and the subsequent attempt to redefine the purchase as a general Lakers jersey without acknowledging the error both contribute to the basis for seeking compensation for the misrepresented product.
1702076748 Seller: Thank you for your feedback. I will offer a refund on your purchase.
1702076776 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, seller kept their review, buyer kept their review, seller did apologize, and buyer didn't apologize.

1702079741 Buyer: i am not comfortable revising my review since it was initally listed as being of a specific player, i don't want other buyers attempting to buy gifts for sick relatives to end up in the same situation i did.
1702079837 Seller: I see. I'm sorry that this misunderstanding was reached, but I believe leaving negative reviews for each other just ends up making us both look bad, as I had every intention to leave you with the same negative review due to the situation at hand. I think we'd be able to make a compromise, but if you're unwilling to due so on your end, you have every right. Either way, I apologize for the original confusion about the listed product purchased.
1702079871 Buyer: what would be the compromise? 
1702079935 Seller: I'd be willing to issue you a refund for this one instance. Although it is not entirely necessary, I think it would be best if we both came to terms with our misunderstandings and dropped both of our reviews. If you're unwilling to due so, out of good faith, I'd still like to offer you the refund. 
1702079995 Buyer: i am open the the refund but would like to leave up my initial review, but i would be willing to revise it stating after communicating with you i recieved a refund 
1702080082 Seller: I can accept that. In the end, I hope you are satisfied enough to consider shopping with me again with confidence. I apologize again for the confusion on your original purchase and hope that things are better clarified for any future purchases you may or may not decide to make. Thank you for your understanding. I'll process the refund to your original payment method and hope you enjoy the rest of your evening!
1702080099 Buyer: thank you for your assistance.
1702080211 Seller: I'll also be removing the bad review on your buyer's profile. Although you desire to want to keep mine up for your own reasoning, I'd like to give you the benefit of the doubt in this situation and retract my initial review on your account. Thank you again for your patience.

1702080379 Seller: Here is a copy of the item description from our website.  There are several colors offered.  Is it possible you thought you checked the box for the black, however, mistakenly marked the orange?  I'm sure we can come to a mutually agreeable solution for this issue.  
1702080453 Buyer: Orange wasn't even available in the size I ordered so I'm not how that could have happened.  I'm hoping we can come to some sort of an agreement.  Either the correct shirt is sent or a full refund to be issued and I will return this one.

1702080790 Buyer: Well the problem is that the name of the player was displayed prominently on your website and then removed. I don't require any type or apology, but I would like a full or partial refund. Thank you.
1702080878 Seller: The name of the player was displayed prominently but that was an example of the type of replica jersey you would be purchasing. I can consider offering you a partial refund only if you pay the shipping and restocking fees and mail me back the item.

1702082005 Seller: I’m sorry for the mix up, but it seems you misread the description of the jersey. However would a trade in be okay?

1702081627 Seller: Hi there! Could you please give me some details on why you'd like a refund, and for what item?
1702081665 Buyer: I ordered a Kobe Bryant jersey for my terminally ill nephew, but the jersey that was sent was a different player.
1702081785 Seller: I'm genuinely so sorry to hear about your terminally ill nephew. I hope that his health isn't declining rapidly, and that you get to create many wonderful memories together. Unfortunately, the product listing for that item explains that the jersey is not for any specific player. I won't be able to offer you a refund as the product listing aligns with the item you received. I hope you understand.
1702081851 Buyer: When I purchased the jersey, the website explicitely stated it was a Kobe Bryant jersey. I have a screenshot of my order which says this. I would like a refund for the price I paid, since this was your error, not mine.
1702081958 Seller: Hmm I think there's some sort of misunderstanding here. I don't offer Kobe Bryant jerseys, so it's just impossible for that product to be advertised in my store. Maybe you looked at others stores and are misremembering one of their listings? I really wish I could help you but unfortunately this is a simple mix-up. I don't think this an error on either of our ends.
1702082042 Buyer: I can send you a screenshot right now. It is your company's name on my confirmation email, as well as Koby Bryant - size youth medium.
1702082121 Seller: Sure, feel free to send me a screenshot. I can track our confirmation emails internally, so I will cross reference your screenshot with the email within our system.
1702082130 Buyer: Excellent!
1702082196 Seller: This screenshot does not align with the email our system shows. I'm sorry, but I can not give you any sort of refund for this. 
1702082245 Buyer: I would like to speak to a supervisor, then.
1702082355 Seller: Unfortunately there is no supervisor as I am the owner of the store. My decision will be final. I promise you, if there was any sort of error on my part I would gladly give you a refund. I have no issue with admitting my wrongdoings and making them right. In this situation, however, the product you purchased was very clearly described as a team jersey, not a specific player's jersey. I can not give you a refund for something that arrived exactly as described.
1702082381 Buyer: What happened to ""the customer is always right?""
1702082451 Seller: I appreciate every single customer that has ever purchased from me, and I definitely appreciate your contribution to my business as well. I will welcome you back if you'd ever like other sports merchandise. I'm sorry I could not provide you a refund in this case.
1702082512 Buyer: This is probably the worst business I have ever ordered from. I am leaving a 1 star review on Facebook, Google Reviews, Instagram, and will make sure you are reported to the Better Business Bureau for fraud.
1702082618 Seller: I'm really disappointed to hear that. Hopefully your nephew will love the jersey regardless, and seeing his joy will make you change your mind. Any disreputable or illegitimate negative reviews can be reported, and I'll be sure to do so. 
1702082688 Buyer: My nephew is extremely disappointed and does not want the jersey of the player we received. The fact that you would do this to a 6 year old boy is unfathomable.

1702081687 Seller: I understand that you would like a full refund but my business is known for it's good reputation. You are sadly just one review out of thousands of great reviews. You made this view wanting another product when you knew that sales were final. I am unable to go back on that policy.
1702081755 Buyer: If you do not give a full refund, I will report you to the Better Business Bureau, and contact thousands on my contact list and get them to leave thousands of negative reviews and bankrupt you.

1702082090 Buyer: My uncle is a lawyer and will give thousands of hours of free legal stuff. You have to pay for it, so you will go bankrupt. It is in your best interest to compromise. I will retract the negative review, you can retract yours, and I will get a full refund. As a compromise, none of us have to apologize. I will also drop all lawsuits and will give you thousands of future referrals.
1702082281 Seller: I regret to inform you that my company's lawyer is a friend of mine and a lawsuit of this magnitude, especially for me would not cost me a dime. Instead so that we both don't need to go through all of this trouble, I can give you a partial refund along with your compromises but that is as far as I can go due to my policy. I have held this policy for many years and I am unable to simply make an exception. It is simply business, my business to be exact.

1702081958 Buyer: Would you consider an exception in this case, I took a photo of the original listing showing it was for Kobe, and after I placed my order and got the Jersey the listing changed. 
1702082092 Seller: While very unlikely that is the case, I understand your frustration. What we can possibly offer in this situation is an exchange for the price difference.
1702082212 Buyer: So in effect, for the exchange, you would refund what I paid for the generic jersey, and I would pay something extra for the Kobe Jersey?
1702082392 Seller: Effectively yes. We have different listings from generic jerseys and player jerseys. Our listings do not change often and its unlikely they listing your purchased changed. In our systems it is the generic in which you purchased. Perhaps it was confused with another tab open at the time. You paid $X which is the general cost of the generic jersey, where as a Kobe jersey would have been charged at $Y. 
1702082512 Buyer: If we do this deal, will you remove your bad review of me?
1702082671 Seller: We think it would be appropriate and in everyone's best interest if it is resolved in such a manner, yes. To confirm, you would like to exchange the generic jersey for the Kobe jersey for the price different, we will send you a label, from there we will both amend our reviews to better reflect the situation.
1702082862 Buyer: That sounds great, I really need the Kobe jersey for my ill relative, and I will remove my bad review of your service, I was upset at the time. I will email you a copy of my screen shot so you can see what I saw when I ordered, and perhaps you will reconsider the additional amount once you see the photo.  I will pay you the additional now so I can get the jersey. thank you
1702083035 Seller: We are glad we could work something out. Again we are sorry you had issues with your order, we will happy to take a look at the photos and double check since you are adamant. We are covering shipping both ways and perhaps a gift will be included. Thank you for your business and we look forward the exchange and amending the feedback.

1702081903 Buyer: Okay so we can circle back to the refund but I think we can both agree that it would be best for all parties to remove our negative reviews of each other as well as apologize to one another.
1702082029 Seller: absolutely! I am sorry for your experience and offer to take the review down. 
1702082051 Buyer: I am sorry as well.  I will take mine down as well.
1702082096 Seller: I am appreciative of this compromise. And feel that this is a good spot to end on.

I am willing to negotiate some things with you. I will issue you a full refund if you return the jersey to me and you retract your negative review of me.

1702082036 Seller: How about if a player partially steps out of bounds? Either way, the player with the ball is out of bounds and you can't step out of the court, even a little bit. What I'm saying is, even though the rules may be tough, ya still gotta play by them

1702081913 Buyer: I understand but I was sent something different than what I ordered.
1702082001 Seller: I also see that you've had issues with other sellers as well
1702082057 Buyer: I'm sorry, what issues are they?  I just would like a refund for incorrect jersey that was sent.  Should I dispute the charge?
1702082139 Seller: The other seller said that you were trying to do the same thing with him just so you could get the item for a lower price
1702082211 Buyer: Not trying for a lower price, just a refund of what I paid and returning the jersey to you.  Not sure what the other seller is referring to as that has never happened.
1702082275 Seller: Ok just this once I can issue a partial refund because again our policy is no refunds at all
1702082410 Buyer: I was sent the wrong item and I would like a full refund or the correct product. If you cannot do that I will share this msg string on your review page and buyers can make their own judgment.  I  will also dispute the charge since the wrong item was sent. Not trying to be mean, just expect you to be fair since you made the error.
1702082490 Seller: I did not make any errors because our products are shipped by machines with special technology so 
1702082673 Buyer: How ever you want to word it, the mistake happened at your end and your quality control failed.  Either way it is not what I ordered. Since you are trying to take advantage of me I will warn other potential buyers and I plan to dispute the charge. My guess is you will be charged back for the item and I will not be required to return the jersey.  This will certainly have an effect on other potential buyers.
1702082752 Seller: I can offer you a refund but you have to send the item first since itsot what you ordered

1702082182 Seller: Let me ask you first, what do you not like about the shirt? 
1702082218 Buyer: It is not the original player that I wanted?  The shirt itself looks OK but not authentic!

1702082324 Buyer: I have screenshots of what the page said and a bill of sale stating what product I was supposed to receive vs. what was delivered. All I want is my money back, the bad review retracted and an apology.
1702082506 Seller: You're welcome to submit your screenshots to our customer service department, but as I've stated, our terms are very clear. Any negative review posted was in response to your failure to read the terms. I apologize for the inconvenience, but we will not be issuing a refund or a retraction.
1702082742 Buyer: How about I submit the screenshots to the review I left or the BBB, proving to other potential buyers that you are unwilling to admit you made a mistake? I'll even be willing to remove my review if you make things right.
1702082972 Seller: Valued customer, our terms are listed clearly across our website. If you feel submitting your screenshots to the BBB will be helpful to future customers, please do so. We encourage full disclosure. As all sales are final, I cannot issue you a refund, but I can offer a retraction of the negative review IF you edit your own review admitting to your mistake as all sales are final.
1702083211 Buyer: I did not make a mistake. I have physical proof that you changed the wording of the listing AFTER I made the purchase, which is illegal. In the long run, giving me a full refund, retracting your review, and apologizing to me will be less expensive than a loss of sales or a lawsuit, which I am willing to do.
1702083392 Seller: That seems like an awful lot of work over something as silly as a jersey, wouldn't you say? Again: These terms are listed clearly across multiple pages on our website and I assure you, we were not concerned with changing the wording on dozens of pages purely to avoid legal issue with you. If you wish to look into pursuing legal action, be my guest. The best I can do is offer a retraction for an admission of your mistake.

1702424081 Seller: Well I can verify that it was described on the site. I see that other sellers have had issues with you as well. 
1702424116 Buyer: I have a screencap verifying my statement
1702424185 Seller: So do I. I am going to make sure all other sellers are aware of this behavior unless you apologize or take down your review. I don't want other sellers to be treated this way.
1702424311 Buyer: Then it would appear that we are at an impasse and the other viewers of your site will make their own judgements. I am contesting the purchase with my card issuer and will refer it to their fraud department,
1702424447 Seller: You are welcome to do that and they can deal with it as they see fit. My main concern is that people stop selling to you, and that will be my goal. Then you won't have this issue anymore and it won't happen to other sellers. I am willing to refund you if you update your review with the truth, as it seems you don't want the item. I however cannot retract my statement as I need future customers to know they can trust me.

1702424467 Seller: Can you tell me what was wrong with the item?
1702424541 Buyer: The item was not as described. I purchased the item specifically as a gift for my nephew who loves Kobe Bryant (which was the jersey I purchased) but I received another players jersey.
1702424606 Seller: I have the listing, as do you, stating exactly what the item was.  It stated a championship jersey.  Nowhere in the listing did it state it was a Kobe Bryant jersey.
1702424700 Buyer: I believe this was in error because at time of purchasing the item's page listed the item as Kobe Braynt's Jersey and only after I purchased it was the page altered to remove the Kobe part.
1702424831 Seller: I cannot alter listings after they have been posted/purchased.  All I can do is remove the listing and put up a new one with the corrected info.  The listing cannot be altered after purchase, so this is literally impossible to have happened.  I apologize if you did not get what you intended, but it is not my fault that you did not pay attention to what you were purchasing.  
1702424910 Buyer: So, there is no way you can do a partial refund? I can take down my bad review for you if you can work something out with me.
1702425029 Seller: I cannot do a partial refund.  My policy states no refunds, and I have the proof needed proving I sent what was listed and purchased.  I have been told by other sellers that you have done the same thing to them.  I am not concerned about the negative review, as my other reviews are positive, and I can easily let others know what really happened.
1702425120 Buyer: Okay, well it doesn't seem like we are going to come to any sort of compromise. I apologize for taking your time and the confusion, take care.

1702424448 Seller: Hello, will you explain what was wrong with the item?
1702424560 Buyer: Well, I screenshot the item details before ordering the item. It states something completely different now than it originally did. The screenshot of the item details states that this is the wrong item.
1702424703 Seller: I am not aware of changing item details as I make sure to detail all the products as accurately as possible. If you would like, I can exchange the item for an equally priced item?
1702424768 Buyer: I would like the Kobe Bryant Jersey that I purchased originally, is that possible? If not I would like a full refund.
1702424985 Seller: Ok, now I understand the issue. I do not specify nor guarantee the player of the jersey. I do make sure explicitly state this in the product details. I will not be able to offer a full refund for this purchase. I will, however, offer an exchange of an equally priced item instead.
1702425129 Buyer: I do not want an equally priced item. I would like a refund and you will get your jersey that is not Kobe Bryant's back. I have proof of what the listing said. Please, can you help me out?
1702425412 Seller: Unfortunately my hands are tied and I cannot offer you a refund. I understand that you were expecting a Kobe Bryant jersey, and I am positive that I did not have it listed as that on my website. The order confirmation on my end does show your purchase, as well as the listing of the product details that say I do not guarantee any specific player's name. I appreciate your interest in my products, however, my jerseys are non refundable and I cannot offer you the refund.

1702424755 Seller: I'm so sorry your nephew is unwell, and I apologize that you misunderstood what the product is. I hope you can find an actual Kobe Jersey. If i had one to offer you, I'd exchange your product. But I don't have the Kobe jersey.
1702424811 Buyer: Well, can I at least get my money back for the one I got, I'll return it, I just want a refund of that, also I really want to get the bad review of me you put up? It's very hurtful.
1702424907 Seller: How about we both remove our negative reviews of each other, now that we understand the cause of your dissatisfaction. In the future, please feel free to reach out to me (the seller) before posting a negative review and see if we can resolve the issue before you write a review.
1702424945 Buyer: As long as I can get a refund then I won't have  a reason for the review, ok?
1702425092 Seller: Well, I hesitate to set a precedent of noncompliance with my stated policy. My policy online states that I do not offer refunds. The product description online is clearly stated, and it does not guarantee a jersey of any specific player. I'm so sorry that you misunderstood what you were purchasing, as that was definitely not my intention. 
1702425207 Buyer: The statement regarding the product name was changed AFTER I got the product though.  It did imply it was a Kobe Jersey in the initial ad. The only way to move forward is to issue a refund. I'm NOT keeping the product, I'll return it to you first. I have no need for it.
1702425367 Seller: Do you happen to have some proof that the description used to state that the product was a Kobe Bryant jersey? I certainly have never posted that myself, and now I am concerned about whether my webshop is being tampered with. If you saw a Kobe Bryant jersey in the description of this item, then I will honor that and provide you a refund, with the understanding that you remove your negative review of my business as it is based on inaccuracies.
1702425481 Buyer: I'm not sure I have a screenshot of it, I'm willing to drop the whole thing if I can get a refund, and you remove my negative review, if you won't then I'll attempt to locate proof, but If I do, I'll make a claim in court WITH that proof, and go for some punitive damages.
1702425699 Seller: I would appreciate any proof you can provide, in order to help me ensure my website is accurate in the future. But I will provide you with a refund because I value your business, and I would like you to be able to purchase a Kobe jersey with that money. I will edit my review of how this transaction went, so that it reflects only the facts of the transaction and has a neutral rating. If you're able to find proof of the description you saw, that stated the jersey was a Kobe Bryant jersey, then I'll be happy to remove the review completely. 
1702425760 Buyer: I appreciate that, I'll also remove my bad review of you, as I mentioned too.

1702425368 Buyer: A partial refund could work.  Can we agree on a partial refund and both agree to retract each others negative reviews of each other?

I did not receive the item listed so I should not be punished for it. Hence why the comment you left was also very unfair. I would like that taken down as well.
1702426367 Seller: On my end it seems like you got the right item. I am not sure why you think you got the wrong item. On my end it seems right. So it doesnt seem right to post a review if the mistake is on your end.
1702426546 Buyer: The item was listed for a kobe bryant jersey when I purchased it. Now it shows as general lakers jersey...a listing that would not fly on any website. I find it very hard to believe something like that was listed so you must have changed it after I contacted you about it to make yourself look better. This jersey was supposed to be for my nephew who is very ill. I searched high and low for a kobe bryant jersey since that is his favorite player. I would not mess something like that up.... there has to be a solution we can come to...
1702426736 Seller: I can assure you the website has been as it always is. You also have reviews from other sellers saying you tried to scam them for a lower price. You can see you have that review so you should understand my concern. I can apologize if you apologize and take the bad review if you take down yours. I feel like a refund is unfair unless you can present me with more evidence. Like I said everything on my end says the jersey was the right jersey.
1702426872 Buyer: I'm all for taking down our reviews but at least a half refund should be fair. I simply can't let this whole situation slide without some form of a refund. I know for a fact it said kobe bryant jersey... I don't even know who the player I got is. I would never order a general jersey for a team I don't even know who all of the players are.

I added your product to my cart because of the player, its great price, and its fast delivery. I left a bad review because I was tricked when I had it - the name of a player I don't know and then you also changed the details about it on the website. I felt I should warn everyone else about your business practices. I am being truthful about my experience. You are not being truthful about your Buyer's review of me, so I think you should take that down instead.

1702426871 Buyer: When have I done this to other sellers? You were the one to remove the Kobe out of your description, which was very dishonest of you. I genuinely just wanted to buy a gift for my nephew and don't want to disappoint him. I would appreciate your help greatly.
1702426987 Seller: I never changed the review and you must have been mistaken as to which listing your were purchasing.  But that is not my fault.  Other sellers have had issues with you in the past with similar issues, and attempting to take advantage of me is unacceptable.  I am willing to remove my review and commentary of your behavior during this transaction if you agree to not do this again going forward and also remove or amend your bad review of my business.
1702427144 Buyer: I am sorry for this entire miscommunication and am willing to remove the bad review of you; however, I would still like to receive a refund as I saw the change and cannot be dishonest by removing your review when I have not gotten my money back. I would like for us to reach the same page please.
1702427273 Seller: All sales are and were final at the time of purchase.  No change to the listing was made and you accusing me of being a liar is unacceptable.  I will accept your apology and removal of the bad review, and all I am willing to offer you is to remove my review and commentary of your behavior.  Otherwise, I am able to provide evidence for what you've said to me here and show that to other sellers.
1702427384 Buyer: I also have a screenshot of the posting before you change it. Please, I just want to give my nephew a gift as he is in the hospital. If you do not understand, I will keep my review up and end the conversation right here. I have been trying to be understanding and civilized, but you have just been accusing of such hurtful things.
1702427454 Seller: I have made my final offer and we'll have to walk away with no deal if you don't accept those terms.  Your screenshot is fraudulent.  Your nephew will love his jersey, as many others have.
1702427491 Buyer: Sounds good, I take back my apology as this miscommunication seems to be coming from you. 
1702427504 Seller: I Walk Away.

1702427498 Seller: Not gaslighting you. I found out about your history on a message board we online owners use.  You've been identified by others. This could be seen as a pattern. Which is illegal. Just trying to help delay your capture.
1702427647 Buyer: I can assure you that I received the wrong shirt and am not doing anything illegal. I just want a partial refund to the 75 dollar shirt since you dont do returns its for my cousin whos in the hospital its not even for me
1702427767 Seller: Sorry to hear that. If we can not agree then from what other owners have told me, you'll be caught soon enough. We have this board to help us win our cases. My offer still stands. If you do not agree to my terms you should walk away. You'll most likely be hearing from my attorney and/or your hometown police department. 
1702427888 Buyer: I Walk Away.

1702427176 Seller: The item clearly stated what it was on the listing. There is every indication you received the item as described.
1702427233 Buyer: When I purchased the item the listing had a different description. The refund would allow me to buy the correct jersey for my very sick nephew
1702427269 Seller: What you are looking for is some type of exchange? If you want this I would want any bad review retracted.
1702427349 Buyer: Yes of course. In the case of a refund I think the best course of action is to remove our negative reviews of each other
1702427441 Seller: Since you were first that would work best if you did that to start then I can return the favor. I can exchange if you know what item you want exchanged for. There isn't any way to refund you if you got the item as described.
1702427578 Buyer: Well the item I purchased was described as a kobe jersey and that is not what I received. A refund would be preferable but I would also accept an exchange for a kobe jersey. I agree to remove the negative feedback. 
1702427666 Seller: If we can do the exchange for that then that would work excellently. Though the listing does say it is for no particular athlete's jersey.
1702427711 Buyer: I think its also fair we apologize to each other for the miscommunication. I apologize for getting upset! 
1702427760 Seller: Sure if you want to add that to your review even so people can know the issue is resolved! I would also update my review.

1702428003 Seller: I am sorry about the mix up. However we do not have players names on the back of the jerseys.  They are Lakers only.
1702428099 Buyer: But it was clearly mentioned that the Jersey was Kobe Bryant's one but now it's been removed from your website. I want the Jersey with Kobe Bryant's name over it or else I want refund

1702428397 Seller: I am so sorry so I will just bite the loss on this one.  The best I can do is have you return the jersey and I can issue you a refund.  
1702428504 Buyer: Ok. But you should do these things as well. 1. Full refund with some compensation for my next purchase on your website. 2. remove negative review and 3. you need to appologize as well

I am sorry that this has happened and will be happy to take down my bad review if you are willingly to do the same.
1702428784 Buyer: I apologize as well for any harsh words from my side. I'll make it easy for you. How about I keep the jersey and you partially refund me? This will help you as well in terms of monetary gains.

1702427667 Seller: The jersey was listed as not being for a specific player, and the store policy is that all sales are final.
1702427767 Buyer: The jersey was specifically listed as a Kobe Bryant jersey. Modifying the listing after the fact does not change that. You and I both know nobody is going to pay $75 for the jersey of some rando. Attempting to deceive me on this matter is not only illegal, it is futile, and it can result in your being removed from the site if I have to escalate this. Your store policy is irrelevant.
1702427920 Seller: The information that I have is that the jersey was specifically not listed as being for a specific player, and I have made no changes to any listings.  If you amend your review to apologize and say you were mistaken I will remove my negative review of you.
1702428112 Buyer: I am not mistaken and will not say so. The listing said it was a Kobe Bryant jersey. Only after I complained initially did the listing change to say otherwise. If it wasn't you who changed it, it was someone else within your company; either way, your company is liable. You should be aware that these changes can be tracked; if I have to escalate this to the marketplace, they will be able to verify that the changes were made. I will get my refund either through you or through them, but if it's through them, you might lose your status as a seller on the site.
1702428271 Seller: I have seen that other sellers have given you negative reviews, and the fact that you are blatantly lying about things that I have done is not helping you case with me.  With an apology and removing your negative review I am willing to remove my negative review.
1702428396 Buyer: I have no other negative reviews. Do you honestly think you can fool me about that? Get real. I will not apologize. Nor shall I remove my review without you first refunding my purchase in full and removing your review; if you do that, I shall CONSIDER removing the negative review. But as it stands, right now my first inclination is to escalate this matter and recommend that your ability to sell be revoked. Understand there is only one positive outcome here for you, and that is if you cooperate with me.
1702428548 Seller: I can see that this is pointless.  I would prefer to reach some kind of agreement, but with someone who contradicts all of the information I have available I see that there is no hope.

1702428838 Seller: I'm not going to give you a refund, but if you send the jersey back, I'll send you the player you want.
1702428994 Buyer: That soundsl like it would be a workable solution.  I will adjust the negative review when I receive the correct jersey.  You could put up a reponse that a miss understanding was had by both sides and I will agree to that.

1702428762 Buyer: It was until you changed it after. That is actual fraud and you can get into a lot of trouble. Instead of losing your account on the platform you can refund me the money and remove your fake review. I will not remove mine and now i need an apology as well.

1702428308 Seller: As stated on the website all items are non refundable.
1702428348 Buyer: I'm sure there is a way to issue one. I did not get what I ordered.  I'd hate to ask my credit card to make the refund happen.
1702428455 Seller: The website clearly stated that all sales are final. So, a refund will not be issued. You received the item you ordered. I will, however, be willing to remove my bad review for you as a buyer if you remove your bad review of me as a seller.
1702428542 Buyer: I have a screen shot of the page from which I ordered, clearly stating it was a Kobe Bryant jersey.  That is not what i received. If you will issue the refund, and remove your review, I'll remove my review as well.
1702428666 Seller: I think you need to look again at the screenshot because the website clearly states that there is no particular player attached to the jersey. We stand firm behind the sale you agreed to when purchasing, and that sale is final. Like previously stated the only thing we will be willing to do for you is remove the review if you agree to removing yours. Thank you. 
1702428794 Buyer: NOW the website says that, but it did not say that on the day that I placed my order,  My nephew is terminally ill, and wanted a specific jersey. I'd not have ordered just any one.  I have a time stamped screen shot, and sadly, if needed, I'll be sending that to the better business bureau as well.  I'm willing to remove the review if you issue the refund and remove yours.  Otherwise, I'm forced to take other action.  
1702428944 Seller: I am so sorry to hear about your nephew. However, the website has always had the same terms. I see you have done this to another seller before which is why I left a negative review for you. As stated previously a refund will not be issued to you but, I will remove my negative review, if you agree to remove yours. 
1702429105 Buyer: I've never had any issue with any other seller, so you are incorrect there.  I'll notifiy my credit card to take back the charge, and report this issue to the better business bureau.  As a business, one would think you would honor your word.  Changing the website after the fact is simply bait and switch, and not professional.  If you want to be trusted as a seller, it's important you fix errors.  It's possible you meant for the website to say a certain thing, and then updated when you realized the error, but that was too late for me, as I'd already placed my order.   
1702429346 Seller: Like I said, the website has stayed consistent. I am a very trusted seller, and I am sorry that you did not read the website before purchasing. Threats will not make me change my policy for you. As stated, several times, no refund will be issued. All I am willing to do is remove the negative review, if you remove yours. What is your final decision on that? 
1702429439 Buyer: There is a subreddit of others having similar issues.  I'm sorry you aren't willing to be an honorable seller.  Clearly we are getting nowhere.
1702429530 Seller: There is no such subreddit. As an honorable seller I will not be issuing a refund when the product is not damaged. All sales are final. Are you removing your review now?

1702430110 Seller: Unfortunately I cannot offer a refund at this time. As clearly stated on my website your purchase was for a Lakers Jersey, and not specifically a Kobe Bryant jersey. Therefore, you did not receive the wrong item. 
1702430265 Buyer: Would we be able to reach a middle ground in this situation, First I would like to apologize for my part in the situation. I can remove my bad review of your shop on the website, and in turn you can remove your bad review of me and offer a refund? 
1702430340 Seller: I am willing to remove my bad review of you in exchange for you removing your bad review of me. However, I still stand in my decision that according to my shop policy I cannot offer you a refund at this time. 
1702430491 Buyer: Would there be any way to offer a refund in this situation, even store credit When I purchased the jersey it specifically stated that it was a Kobe Bryant Jersey and it is bad for business to sell a customer the wrong item knowingly. 
1702430780 Seller: I am sorry that you think I would knowingly sell you the wrong product. It was not my intention to mislead you. As stated on the site, the jersey was a generic Lakers jersey, and not specifically a Kobe Bryant jersey. In this situation I can offer you a partial refund, but I will have to keep my negative review of you as a buyer up as a way to warn future sellers.
1702430991 Buyer: As I've apologized to you can you offer me an apology as well? I will accept your partial refund if you do not leave up the negative review because if you leave up your negative review I will leave my negative review up. 
1702431217 Seller: I appreciate your apology and I apologize that you feel misled. I will offer you a partial refund, but my negative review will stay up. 
1702431375 Buyer: if your negative review stays up so will mine, and that would be the worst-case scenario for both of us and it would damage our opportunity to do business on this app forever let's both remove our reviews and I keep the partial refund and return the jersey.

1702429934 Seller: I'm sorry that you thought that but the listing made no such claim. 
1702429989 Buyer: It did have Kobe Bryant on the listing, but it was later removed. Because of this, I wish to have a full refund. In exhange, 
1702430125 Seller: This is simply not true and you know this.  Furthermore you have tried this tactic on other sellers.  There will be no refund at all.  The only acceptable solution to me would be your retraction of the bad review and a public apology stating that you have lied about my business.  In exchange for that I will remove my negative review of you and your shady ethics. 
1702430254 Buyer: I will not remove my review, because I feel that I am the one who has been wronged. I will keep up the bad review if I don't receive at least a refund. Aside from that, I have a near perfect rating by everyone else, so I can make my case if I need to, and I will warn others of this issue. I think it's quite sneaky. I am willing to remove my negative review only if I receive a full refund. That way I recoup what I lost and can get my nephew's jersey elsewhere. If it was just about me it would be different, but this is about a young man that's affected as well.
1702430393 Seller: I'll repeat this for you: there will be no refund.  You are the one with a history of taking advantage of sellers, this is. a reputation you have earned through your actions and it is well earned.  I have never edited a listing in such a dishonest manner and am insulted that you would insinuate that I did.  The only concession I would be willing to make from my prior stance is removing the need for a public apology. 
1702430628 Buyer: If that's the case, I might have to add to my review and make my case further. I don't see why we can't just come to an agreement where you get back your jersey, I get back my money, and we both remove our reviews of each other. A public apology isn't a top priority for me when I have a nephew without his Kobe Bryant jersey, a bad review of me that I don't understand, and now am stuck with a jersey of an unknown player. I actually have a screenshot of when Kobe Bryant was mentioned in the previous post, and I'm happy to add that to my review to prove my case to others so they no longer buy from you. 
1702430767 Seller: While I'm hesitant to even offer this and allow you to continue to scam others I'm willing to offer a partial refund, you can keep the jersey and you remove the review of me.

This is very bad business practice, you should not be lying to your customers.
1702492327 Seller: There is no proof that I changed anything as advertised. I can show you the receipts from previous products and it shows that no player is advertised. There is no lying occuring, I am a truthful business with plenty of purchases.
1702492466 Buyer: It was clearly advertised as a Kobe Bryant jersey, I would not have bought it otherwise. I bought this jersey for my terminally ill nephew, he is a huge Kobe Byant fan, I checked at least a dozen times to make sure it was correct. Now you have stolen my money with a false advertisement and I have nothing to give him.
1702492522 Seller: If you can provide me proof that it is for your terminally ill nephew, only then can I provide a refund. Otherwise all I can do is take down review.
1702492712 Buyer: While I appreciate your offer to take down the review, how do you propose I provide proof of his illness? His doctors are not going to provide a note when I am only his aunt, and this is just an online purchase, not exactly a life or death situation. I just wanted to surprise him with something he would really enjoy in his last days, and I have recently lost my job so I cannot afford to buy two of these jerseys. The refund would allow me to get him another jersey, one that actually says Kobe Bryant.

1702496338 Buyer: The awful name calling in the retaliation review.
1702496411 Seller: It was not from my company. I know you are lying because I am the one in control of writing reviews and I didn't write bad names. 
1702496477 Buyer: Excuse me? I bought the jersey from you and reached out this way prior. 
1702496569 Seller: The only reason why I wrote a retaliation review was because you wrote a lieing review about my company. However, I didn't write any bad names regarding you.
1702496679 Buyer: Calling me a liar is doing just that. But you just said you didn't write the review and now you are admitting to it. This is a really bad business practice. Not to mention, my review was simply warning of my negative experience.
1702496824 Seller: I never not admit I wrote the review. I just said I didn't write the bad name you are claiming. All you do is lie, from your review.  You owe us an apology.  The only reason you wrote the negative review was because you didn't get what you want in the first place, not because my company treated you wrongly. 
1702497030 Buyer: You wrote false advertising. When I wanted a refund for the mistake, you refused. This jersey was for my cancer riddled nephew. I wanted to make sure you couldn't swindle someone else out of their hard earned money. I will not apologize for helping others. You continue to tell me I'm lying when I am not. your customer service is poor and I will report you to the better business bureau if you don't refund and retract your bad review.

Unfortunately, nowhere does it list a specific player so I cannot fully grasp this if you looked hard for this specific jersey.

It was promptly shipped. Two weeks later demanding a refund and leaving me a review calling me a crook. You then mention you'd remove the review if I provided a refund. I hope you understand how this appears on my end.

1702497019 Buyer: If you do not give me a refund then I will be forced to leave a very bad review.

1702497318 Buyer: How about a partial refund. We can meet each other in the middle. However, I keep the jersey.

1702497262 Seller: As stated on our website, the jersey was not listed as being for a specific player.  It's a championship jersey for the Lakers, not a player specific jersey.  It's what's given to players to wear when they win.
1702497335 Buyer: That's not how I recall reading it. I know what I was shopping for and would not have purchased that.
1702497447 Seller: I'm sorry, but that's what was listed on the website as was it stated on the website that all sales are final.  It's a replica championship jersey.  Championship jerseys never have the players names.  They're just made for celebration, hence they toss them out to the players live on TV after they win.
1702497547 Buyer: Ok. Well you can lose my business (I've purchased from you prior). I will not retract my review.
1702497621 Seller: I've seen your reviews, I've seen what you've left for other sellers as well.  We both don't need the negative reviews.  They hurt me as a seller and you as a buyer.  We both should agree to want to have these removed.
1702497735 Buyer: I agree but I feel like I had an issue and you won't resolve it so a review is needed. I would prefer a review that says how helpful you were with an issue.
1702497902 Seller: I'm trying to be helpful.  I've informed you of what was listed on the website, details of the jersey, and the fact that all sales are final.  I'm unable to process a return on final sale items.  This isn't done for you, this is true of all buyers on all sales are final items.  That's why such a title is listed.  If it were incorrect an exception could be made, but the website states it's not a player specific jersey.  I understand you want a Kobe jersey, but there's no championship Kobe jersey, it's just a general celebration jersey.  Kobe wore exactly it without his name on it in the game.  It's accurate to the championship game.  If it said Kobe on it, it would be fake as no such jersey has never existed which such a design.
1702498032 Buyer: Then I think this conversation is over. I will keep my review out there and hope others don't run into the same issue I did. No apology on either part is needed.
1702498091 Seller: Wow, you would rather us both be affected from buying and selling.  I would at least remove negative reviews.  That hurts you long after this one dispute.  Why would you wan to have that burden.
1702498132 Buyer: Its a risk worth taking
1702498242 Seller: I've said sorry to you, I've explained the details of the item you've purchased, and you won't even provide a simple sorry.  I'm trying to work with you here.  As stated, you bought an all sales are final item.  All sales final means no refunds.  I cannot process a refund on an item that doesn't exist.  There's no such thing as a Kobe championship jersey.  That would be a fake jersey.

1702497480 Buyer: The jersey arrived torn and dirty as though it was returned before. I would like to return it to you and receive a full refund. If you do not comply, I will be leaving a bad review on your site. Thanks in advance.
1702497595 Seller: If I am understanding correctly you are now changing your story and saying that the jersey came torn and dirty and not broken? I hand package those jerseys myself and there is no way this jersey was torn or dirty when I packaged it due to the quality control that it has to go through before it leaves the store. There is no reason to leave a false bad review for your product and I hope you will reconsider. 
1702497824 Buyer: The jersey Is in fact torn and dirty and I would just like it either replaced with a perfect one or a refund so I could purchase one elsewhere. Perhaps, your quality control and mine are different. I don't want to be a problem, I would just like to receive a product in perfect condition for my money. 
1702497931 Seller: I apologize but my policy is that I can not replace or refund items without proof of damage, neither of which you are providing me. It is well within your right to write a review based off of your experiences but I just ask that you do not jeopardize the future of my business by writing an untruthful one. 
1702498200 Buyer: I do in fact have proof of the damage. I took a picture of the jersey and the flimsy bag it was shipped in. I am not asking to keep the damaged jersey, I am offering to send it back to you so you could perhaps figure out what went wrong with the shipping of this. I just want a jersey for my friend. I almost never write bad reviews on companies but if you insist on refusing to make this right, I will have to.
1702498280 Seller: My products are not shipped in bags, they are shipped in boxes as it says on my page so I am having a hard time believing that your story is truthful. I will not be offering you a refund.

1702497600 Buyer: I want either 50% or 20% if you retract the bad review of me and formally apologize then i'll remove my review 
1702497669 Seller: how about this 45% off if you apologize to me and take down review
1702497836 Buyer: I would do that for 70% off. But why did you change the descriptions of the item from the time i ordered to receiving the product? When running a business you should tend to the needs of the customer and be transparent about your products. What you did felt shady, and I should have purchased from a competitor. 
1702497936 Seller: 75% off ill remove negative review of you you remove my negative review no apology needed and 30% off next order

1702498536 Seller: Our policy is that we don't offer refund though we can exchange for a different item. Would you like that
1702498759 Buyer: No, I really would like the refund. I bought the item as advertised, being a Kobe Bryant Jersey, and received the wrong item. I believe this should definitely be remedied with a refund as it faults on you, the seller.

1702497886 Seller: My listing clearly stated that the jersey was not for a specific player.  I have not deleted any listings.  I only left a review for you when I noticed another vendor had  a similar run in with you.

1702498840 Buyer: Please do, there are so many other websites I can purchase from, but your brand will be ruined forever. I don't care about your one review of me as a buyer on this one website. Also, obviously I can't post the evidence here since it's just a text chat, but I'll happily do it on the website. Your business will be destroyed, I will just be able to buy an actual Kobe jersey on a different platform.

1702498160 Buyer: All is good here, thank you! I'm writing in reference to the order I placed for the Kobe Bryant jersey. The jersey that arrived is not the one which was advertised, and I'd appreciate a refund so I can get my nephew the present he wants. I know I posted a bad review of your shop, and I'm certainly willing to take that down if you're able to help make things right.
1702498370 Seller: I can understand how important it is to get the right gift, but the jersey that was advertise was specifically stated to not be for a specific player. If the jersey is currently in mint condition and you wish to return it, I would be happy to see if an exchange for a jersey that more closely meet your needs would be possible. Given that this started with a misunderstanding, taking down the review would be an excellent first step in proceeding to resolve this in good faith.
1702498591 Buyer: That would be fine with me, thank you. The jersey was never worn and placed back in its original packaging. I'd be happy to exchange it for the jersey we thought we were purchasing. I'll take down my negative review, assuming you'll do the same for the review you wrote about me, and will certainly post an updated, positive one once the exchange is complete.
1702498830 Seller: Yes, it's perfectly acceptable for me to retract my review once yours is gone. For the time being, would you be willing to update your review to note that we are currently in the process of attempting to resolve this issue and that the verdict at least still out as to whether I am in fact a ""liar and a crook""?
1702498928 Buyer: Yes, I can do that. To summarize, we're going to work on an exchange for the correct jersey, I'll remove my negative review, and you'll review your negative review?
1702499030 Seller: Yes, that works for me, but you have to agree that you used some pretty strong language against me that could have made a bad impression on others and threaten my future business. I'd appreciate you also including an apology for that in the new review.
1702499184 Buyer: Sure, I'll include that apology provided you do the same for calling me a liar and slanderer. We probably both used language which was less-than-ideal in the heat of the moment.
1702499291 Seller: I can agree with that. Given that we agree on the terms, I'm going to clarify that I will list the exchange as a partial refund for the terms of our deal. Is that acceptable?

1702498026 Seller: Well yes, because it can be any jersey, even a kobe bryant jersey, you must not have picked the right thing

1702497983 Seller: I can't offer a refund because the item arrived as listed on our website.
1702498033 Buyer: It was listed as a limited edition Kobe Bryant jersey, which is not the jersey that I received. I feel that is false advertising, and would really like a refund so that we can both simply walk away from this dispute and move on. 
1702498091 Seller: It was not listed as a limited edition Kobe Bryant jersey. It was listed as a general Lakers jersey without a specific player. I apologize if there was a misunderstanding, but we cannot offer a refund because the item was delivered as listed.
1702498128 Buyer: I would love to see evidence of that, as I can provide evidence that it was listed as a limited edition Kobe Bryant jersey.
1702498149 Seller: Please provide evidence of the Kobe Bryant jersey listing and I'd be happy to issue the refund.
1702498251 Buyer: Sweet, if you provide your contact information, I could do that. I'm not trying to be rude or to ruin your business, I just want the refund because the jersey is for my terminally ill nephew, who is a huge Kobe fan. I just want to be able to purchase him the jersey he wants. I am perfectly willing to return the jersey I recieved to you, so that you can sell it to someone else--it's not like the jerseys are new. 
1702498306 Seller: If you were issued a refund, would you be willing to retract your bad review of my business?
1702498337 Buyer: Yes, if you would also be willing to retract your bad review of me. I don't feel any animosity towards you or your business. 
1702498386 Seller: Provided you can provide proof of the incorrect listing, we can agree to both retract our negative reviews. Does that sound good?
1702498423 Buyer: Yes, as long as that agreement also includes a refund for me, provided I return the jersey I received to you in the same condition.

1702498249 Seller: Hello! Can you explain why you need a full refund?
1702498309 Buyer: I did not receive the product I paid for. The website description indicated I would receive a specific Kobe Bryant jersey, but I received a uniform from a completely different player.
1702498339 Seller: I have checked the website and verified that it did not state which player would be on the jersey, so i will not be issuing a refund.
1702498384 Buyer: This website has clearly been changed. I can show the order confirmation I received that shows that the purchase was for that specific player.
1702498418 Seller: I can also prove that the website has clearly not been altered, and can have other customers that purchased the same item verify as well.
1702498647 Buyer: I don't think that you can prove it. If you cannot offer me a refund for the purchase I made in good faith, I will have to escalate by issuing a chargeback to my credit card.
1702498684 Seller: You are more than welcome to do that for yourself, I'm sorry that you were mistaken on the product's details when you made the purchase.
1702498783 Buyer: You realize that this will result in you having to pay the refund anyway, and you might have to pay penalties on top of that? It would be much easier if you just refund my purchase. I can return the jersey you sent me if that's what you want.
1702498821 Seller: If you are unhappy with the product and would like to return it, i can then issue a refund for that.

1702499032 Seller: I will remove the bad review if you apologize for the trouble you have caused my business.
1702499177 Buyer: I do apologize for any trouble I might have caused. It's very possible I was mistaken as to what the website said.

You sold me an item that wasn't what was advertised, and that negative review will make it known to future potential customers of yours. If you refund my money it all goes away as an honest mistake that you worked honestly to resolve. Surely the refund of one purchase doesn't offset the future losses you'll incur.

1702511055 Seller: How about I give you a partial refund since the posting did state that it wouldn't be a specific jersey? I will take down the negative review once you take yours down.
1702511151 Buyer: When I was looking at the posting it did say it was specifically a Kobe Bryant Jersey, I am so sorry if there was a misunderstanding. I would like the full refund and Ill take my review down.
1702511266 Seller: Okay, it looks like there definitely was a misunderstanding. We do have a Kobe Bryant Jersey in stock, would you accept a replacement jersey sent out instead of a refund? 
1702511322 Buyer: That would be fantastic, I can send the one I received back. Would you happen to have a photo of that one so I can be sure?
1702511400 Seller: Of course, let me send you a picture and I do apologize for the misunderstanding. Let me know what size you would like and if you are okay with this Jersey.
1702511506 Buyer: Thank you so much! Ill take a size 6 if you have it. I will also go ahead take down my review if you are willing to remove yours.
1702511604 Seller: Okay great, I have just e-mailed you a return label. We do have a size 6 in stock and I can ship this one out as soon as we receive the other one. I will go ahead and remove the negative review now. Thanks for coming to an understanding and for the resolution!

I purchased a Kobe Bryant jersey, but received another player's jersey.
1702511152 Seller: Thankyou for reaching out.  I am sorry you are not satisfied.  However, the product description did not include any specific player.
1702511220 Buyer: I have to disagree. I purchased this for my terminally ill nephew, and a Kobe jersey is the only thing he wanted. I wouldn't have ordered a generic team jersey.
1702511286 Seller: Again, I am sorry, but without you specifying when you placed the order, we have no way of knowing that you wanted to specific player jersey.  How can we resolve this?
1702511335 Buyer: Is it possible to exchange the jersey, or get a refund? I want us to resolve this while also removing the negative reviews we both posted.
1702511405 Seller: I can check to see if we have any Bryant jerseys in stock and if we do we can definitely do an exchange.
1702511447 Buyer: That would be wonderful, thank you so much! And would you also remove the bad review on the site?
1702511566 Seller: Yes, I can do that provided you either retract your review of me.  I see that we do have a Bryant jersey in stock.  You will need to return the jersey you originally received.  Once we receive it back, we will ship out the Bryant jersey.
1702511648 Buyer: I will send the jersey via signature delivery to ensure it reaches you, and wait to receive the replacement before altering my review. 
1702511744 Seller: Ok.  While you are waiting for the jersey, can you please edit it and apologize for the mix up on your part and that we are working together to resolve the issue?
1702511908 Buyer: I'm fine with editing the bad review to include an update on our new terms, but I can't apologize as I posted an honest review of what transpired. I would like an apology for the name-calling response you left for me, as well as have you update your review. 
1702512136 Seller: Thank you for updating your reviewing.  I am sorry for the name calling.  As a sign of good faith I will update my review apologizing for doing so once we finish today.  After you receive the replacement jersey, I would appreciate it if you could again update your review to reflect that we were able to amicably resolve the issue.  Does that work?

1702511466 Seller: The product was advertised correctly and you misread. The best I can do is offer a partial refund since it was not a mistake on my part.
1702511510 Buyer: I disagree because you altered the website after the purchase, making it seem as if I was lying more or less which is obviously not very ethical.
1702511542 Seller: I did not alter the website. This is a blatant lie and if you don't accept the partial refund, I will not be refunding at all.
1702511595 Buyer: Even if you didn't it was clearly false advertising. There's a big difference between showing a ""Kobe Bryant"" jersey and sending a jersey of some random player almost nobody has ever heard of.
1702511658 Seller: The website clearly stated that the item was not for a specific player. Partial refund revoked. No refund.

1702511603 Buyer: IT isn't a Kobe Bryant jersey like the site said. It was for someone I've never heard of. At the time I bought it, it was on the site as a Kobe jersey. I want a refund and a retraction of my negative buyer review. 
1702511775 Seller: I cannot do a refund because the site clearly states what you have purchased. I'll tell you what I can do since I value you as a fellow sports fan and customer. How about you keep that jersey for a Kobe family or friend, and I send you an additional jersey that meets your specific needs. I will remove your negative buyer review as long as you remove my negative seller review. This offer shows how important you and every customer is to me. I want everyone to be happy with our service. Would you kindly accept?
1702511868 Buyer: I want a refund completely so that I can buy it elsewhere. If I get an apology and get my negatrive reivew removed, I will reove the negative review for you. 
1702512052 Seller: I understand you want a refund but the description matches what you have received. This would not be efficient for me. I also have nothing to apologize for since I can prove everything is truthful on my end. We can remove the negative reviews to start. I am still willing to offer you another jersey on the house but I need an apology on your end as well. 
1702512127 Buyer: I did nothing wrong ,so I won't be apologizing. The site was changed after I bought the jersey so that it no longer says it's a Kobe Bryant jersey. This is fraud. I want a complete refund, and apology, and I want my negative review taken off. 
1702512249 Seller: The refund is not happening. You have no leverage here. You have to prove that I ""changed the site"" and the cost of taking me to small claims court wouldn't make sense. My final proposal is another jersey of your choice and removal of the negative review. I wouldn't be this direct if I knew I was in the wrong. Out of all my business you are the only one to make such an outrageous claim. Take it or leave it.
1702512316 Buyer: NO, I want a refund. Last offer. I will report you to the state attorney general's office for fraud if I don't get my money back. And until I get my negative review taken off, I wont negotiate with your further.

1702512185 Buyer: It was a Kobe Bryant jersey I purchased. I specifically searched for this particular jersey as it is for my sick nephew and it is his favorite player. I received a jersey with another player I am unfamiliar with and would like to return this for a refund so I may purchase the correct jersey. 
1702512400 Seller: okay. Thanks for reaching out to us. we are really sorry for every inconveniences this must have caused you. i would also like you to know that we do not allow our customers returning products after purchase its part of our company policy.
1702512572 Buyer: That's fine as a policy but there is also a policy for consumers that all merchants must follow in that they are to deliver what is purchased. If not, the purchase can be disputed with my credit card company under the clause of merchandise not as described or even as item not received as you failed to deliver the item I purchased. I do not want to have to file a dispute as it will take time from my day and end up costing you far more as a merchant. Therefore I suggest that you refund the price, I will send the jersey back, and we can go forward from there. 
1702512744 Seller: The jersey you claimed to have purchased from our website has been out of stock for a while now and its not on the website.
1702512853 Buyer: Then you should have done more to make sure that it was unavailable to purchase on the website. Your stock quantity and what you display on your website is understandably an issue and I can understand how it makes things more complicated but again that is not an issue for me to resolve for you. The issue is that I need a refund for a jersey that I have not received.

1702513234 Buyer: I will continue to leave the review up until I receive a refund. I'm certain your company knows how to issue one, policy or not. You could have simply attempted to rectify and fixed his instead of responding the way you did. So until I receive a refund and an apology, I will not retract anything and I will continue to leave reviews as to just what kind of fraudulent practices you have.

1702512145 Seller: I'm sorry to hear that.  The terms are that all sales are final, but I would consider an exchange for an equally priced item under the circumstances if you are willing to delete the negative review.  We did nothing wrong on our end.

Again, while I would prefer to not have the review on my account, anyone who reads it will see that you were mistaken.

I send you back the jersey, you refund my money and we both delete our negative review. Make it like the whole thing never happened.

I will remove the ad review if You agree to publish an apology on my page and agree to take back the item and give me a full refund. It’s the moral thing to do

1702570723 Buyer: I've ordered a sports uniform specifically with Kobe Bryant on it, but the item that came features a different basketball player.
1702570818 Seller: I see. But in our website it is specifically said that the Lakers jersey you purchased was not associated with any player in specific, therefore there was not an option to choose a player on the back of the jersey.
1702570869 Buyer: We both know that is untrue and I have screenshots from your website and product details upon the time of order to back up this claim.
1702570979 Seller: There is no possibility of that and also if you had read our policy for no refunds you would also know that a refund claim is not possible. I am very sorry for the inconvenience but there is nothing we can do about this issue.
1702571128 Buyer: I have read your policy which clearly has stated all refunds are granted within 30 days of purchase. This item was quite important for my grandson who is currently in chemo therapy, and it's very telling of your character how you mistreat your customers.

1702571811 Seller: Hi, How may I help you?
1702571871 Buyer: I was very unhappy with a purchase I made in your website. I specifically purchased a Kobe Bryant jersey and I received a jersey with another player's name on the back.
1702571908 Seller: When was the purchase made?
1702571929 Buyer: This week
1702572011 Seller: It is clearly stated on the product details that it is a LA Lakers replica jersey, therefore it does not have any player names printed on the back
1702572137 Buyer: That is a lie. I saw on your website at the time of purchase that you had a special promotion specifically for Kobe Bryant jerseys. I have the email purchase that prooves it. I would like either a full refund or for you to send me the jersey that I ordered
1702572289 Seller: As I have mentioned before, our store only sells replica jerseys and they do not player names. I'm sorry that you are unhappy with your purchase, but the store terms also state that all purchases are final.
1702572430 Buyer: Well if that is the case I will leave a very poor review with the printscreens of the email and the jersey I received so that other people don't get wronged like I was
1702572582 Seller: That would be very unfortunate. Our records show that you received your order two weeks ago, and you are only expressing your dissatisfaction now.
1702572662 Buyer: If your're keeping with your story, that's your business. I will post the review if there is no compensationon your side
1702572900 Seller: Again I'm sorry that you are unhappy with your purchase as we value you as our client. We could consider  offering you a refund provided that you mail us back the jersey in its original packaging
1702572933 Buyer: That seems fair
1702573053 Seller: Please note that this will not be a full refund because of shipping and admin fees
1702573157 Buyer: I understand but I want a full refund on the amount paid for the jersey itself
1702573213 Seller: Unfortunately that will not be possible. It is either a partial refund or no refund at all
1702573267 Buyer: What is the percentage of the refund?
1702573332 Seller: 90% of the total amount paid for the product

1702570795 Buyer: I ordered a Kobe Bryant shirt and got a different players shirt, you changed the offer on the site but I could sue your business for false advertisement
1702570939 Seller: with all due respect, the order under your name is for Lakers shirt. I can get my lawyer invested if that is your wish, as well as an IT specialist, who will confirm the fact that I did not change anything on my side. What I suggest is you making a formal apology before legal actions are taken, as they can bring poor consequences to you. 
1702571060 Buyer: Ok, then, either I get my refund or I keep my negative review and we walk away from this with both of us getting into a legal battle
1702571181 Seller: I am more than happy to get into a legal battle, hence I insist on apologizing formally and deleting negative comment, since, as we both know, that is far away from truth. That is my final word before I hand over this case to my lawyer. 
1702571336 Buyer: So what you are saying is, i get no refund, I have to take down my bad review and then I have to apologize, after you scammed me, and then posted a response to my comment insulting me
1702571528 Seller: I have an electronical record of every single order on my site and no negative reviews, before yours. If we take this to cord and I show this, there will be nothing you will be able to do to defend yourself. Even in your confirmation email there is a confirmation of purchasing Lakers team shirt. Were I you, I would appreciate this offer, as this could get ugly for you. Please reconsider it, as my lawyer is getting invested.

1702573744 Buyer: Clearly you don't care about your customers satisfaction. What kind of service is this?
1702573788 Seller: That's not true. I'm offering you a partial refund and a apologize. In exchange, I think it's fair to ask for an apology from your side too.

1702575219 Seller: I am sorry about that. Did you happen to take a video while unboxing the item?
1702575293 Buyer: Unfortunately I did not take a video, however I have the receipt to show that I bough it today earlier on
1702575370 Seller: I regret to inform you that sales are final, as mentioned on the website, so without a video I cannot confirm that the item was already damaged when you received it. Therefore I cannot do anything about it. I apologize once again.
1702575435 Buyer: So there is no way I could get a refund or exchange? it is an appliance and it does not switch on at all
1702575546 Seller: Unfortunately no. You could go ahead and try to contact the manufacturer directly and see if they can offer you an exchange, especially if the product has manufacturer warranty. I cannot do anything more about this. Would you possibly be willing to remove the negative review? It does not seem like we are in the wrong here since we mention that the sales are final. Thank you.

1702596144 Buyer: Okay, I will be leaving my review up and will also update it to include how unreasonable you have been during this chat. The only way to stop a bad review and not get your business tarnished is to give me a refund. I did nothing wrong here. I'm being reasonable. I would also like an apology now as well. 
1702596252 Seller: There will be no apology from you either so you might as well keep the jersey. Once again, our website specifically stated that it was no person's jersey in particular; including Kobe Bryant.
1702596439 Buyer: You changed the website after I made my purchase. That is unethical. I have screenshots of the website before the change. I'm going to include those pictures in my review to further prove you are a liar. I guarantee no everyone will be cautious when they are deciding if they will shop on your website or not. You are extremely rude. I'm sorry that you are the way that you are. I deserve a refund at the very least.
1702596548 Seller: Are you sure you purchased the jersey from our website because that information was up there from the very beginning. You can talk to our IT department if you would like?
1702596659 Buyer: I promise the information was not there in the beginning. I have proof. I am sorry for being rude. I would please just like a refund as I purchased this jersey for my sick nephew who is a huge Kobe Bryant fan. I would really appreciate if you could make this situation right. Thanks for offering to talk to the it department but I feel that is not needed in this situation.
1702596722 Seller: There is nothing more I can do for you so I would recommend you just enjoy your wonderful jersey.
1702596822 Buyer: This is very unfortunate. I will be keeping up my review unfortunately unless I am refunded. My sick nephew will not be happy with this jersey, although it is wonderful, since neither of us know who this player is. 
1702596885 Seller: Just tell your nephew it's a special number for him.
1702596989 Buyer: Thank you for the suggestion but I know my nephew will only be happy with a Bryant jersey. If you refund me and you have any Bryant jerseys in stock I will return the other jersey and also purchase the correct one from you and remove my review. Please, I'm trying to work things out to benefit both of us.
1702597099 Seller: Think about it for once, when he wears the jersey, he will know that it's his on special number; so when he plays basketball he can really feel like a true LA Laker.
1702597192 Buyer: A Bryant jersey will mean more to my nephew than some made up number. My nephew is sick also, he cannot play basketball. He will never be able to feel like a Laker since he is bedridden. From his bed though, he can be a Kobe fan always. Please reconsider.

Can you assure me that you have made any changes in how you conduct your business that would safeguard future customers?

1702597201 Buyer: Just to be clear, your business was the one responsible for the mistake. The jersey was clearly labeled when I purchased it, and I received something different. That said, if you offer a full refund and remove the review about me, I will retract the review of you.

The site was at best misleading. 
1702598344 Seller: Hello, I am sorry that you feel that but as stated the website clearly states it was not for a specific player and  that all sales were final. 
1702598432 Buyer: How could you possibly expect that someone would purchase a random jersey from some no name player. People buy jerseys for specific people. I clearly remember seeing the picture of a Kobe jersey with his number as the picture. I'm sure we can come to some agreement here. 
1702598506 Seller: As i mentioned before it was clear on the website that all sales are final. You went and wrote a bad review for me when it was your mistake for not thoroughly reading the ad.
1702598583 Buyer: I did thoroughly read it but the ad was changed after the fact. Listen, you have a business to run and I don't have time for this. I have this Jersey of yours that I no longer want. I'll send it back so you can sell it to someone else but I would like a refund. 
1702598641 Seller: Now you are accusing me of fraud yet you want me to provide you with a full refund. 
1702598722 Buyer: There is no accusation. Only the facts. Let's compromise, you process a refund for me and in exchange, I'll amend my review - which I'm sure is affecting your business. Customers really do care about conflict resolution. 
1702598779 Seller: Here is what i will offer. If you retract the bad review and apologize i will refund your order. That is my final offer.
1702598824 Buyer: How about we both apologize for the confusion, you refund my order and I'll retract my bad review. 
1702598869 Seller: I think you misunderstand what the phrase final offer means. Its either a yes or a no and you keep the product with no refund.

1702599105 Seller: I assure you, that is exactly what the site stated. Under the description of the item it says that you are purchasing a Lakers jersey, no specific player is mentioned. I understand you may have wanted a Kobe jersey, but the jersey in the product photo is not even Kobe's jersey number. I am sorry you may have been confused, but the product page gave no detail of it being a Kobe jersey.

1702598797 Seller: Then you should have been more careful reading the ad and noticed it was not player specific. You wrote a bad review that is lies. I would like you to either remove the review or update the review with an apology for the lies you made against my company.
1702598863 Buyer: First, I need the refund to be able to purchase the Kobe Bryant jersey
1702598941 Seller: I cannot be held responsible for your negligance. Again, it is stated no returns/refunds and this order was fulfilled correctly on my end so you are not getting a refund. I have submitted a negative review of your as a buyer to make others aware that this situation is not my fault.
1702599002 Buyer: I would be willing to retract my review if you are willing to work with me and give me a refund

1702598727 Buyer: I will be willing to retract the bad review from your store if I get a refund and you retract my bad review.
1702598833 Seller: I understand that you believe we sent the incorrect item, however our site does state all sales are final.  Furthermore, your order was for an item without a name so it couldn't have been a wrong player's jersey.  I am willing to remove the review for you.
1702598951 Buyer: I am confident that the listing was changed after I reached out. Unless I get a refund, I am unwilling to retract the bad review.
1702599033 Seller: I'm sorry you feel that way.  I can assure you we did not change the listing.  It is still an excellent jersey.  You could see if your nephew likes it or try reselling it?  
1702599126 Buyer: My nephew is terminally ill and I wanted to get him a Kobe Bryant jersey specifically. If there is no refund, there is no deal.
1702599235 Seller: That is awful news to hear.  Would you be willing to remove the review and leave an apologetic positive view if I removed your review and offered you the full refund?

1702599623 Seller: The item description was complete, you could have asked any questions before purchase. Website clearly states that all sales are final.
1702599664 Buyer: It said Kobe not this player you sent, do I really have to file a chargeback on my credit card? 
1702599706 Seller: That would be considered fraud.  I will take all necessary steps if you chose to go that direction.
1702599740 Buyer: Fraud is sending the wrong item, I have screenshots of what was listed. I'm willing to give you a chance before I go ham.

1702600081 Buyer: Is that including the return shipping? It is still in it's original package, I've taken video to even send you. 
1702600190 Seller: If you opened the box and saw it was the wrong jersey, how is it in the original packaging.  Like I said, I will refund you when I receive and inspect it. You are responsible for shipping.
1702600270 Buyer: We never opened the plastic, anyone can read the lettering and put two and two together. I can deal with that, if you hold up to your end I will remove the bad review as long as you remove mine. Will that work? 
1702600342 Seller: Yes.  This is my last communication with you until I receive the jersey.  I will remove the review after the refund is complete.

1702601127 Buyer: I appreciate your response, but the jersey advertised at the time of my purchase specifically mentioned Kobe Bryant, which was the main reason for my purchase. Since the item delivered does not match the product description from when I placed my order, I believe a refund is justified in this situation.

A more fitting resolution would be a full refund for this specific transaction and i shall remove all negative comments about your brand.
1702601563 Seller: No refund that is the policy for all sales.  I can not make an exception for you.  Fair is fair.

1702605024 Seller: You have already left us negative feedback.  Also, other sellers have reported you as an unreliable buyer such as demanding refunds for non-existent problems or trying to get discounts after paying.  You are putting your account at risk from the auction website.  When that happens you get flagged as a fraudulent buyer and won't be able to use the website anymore.

1702636710 Seller: well after all i offered you are still unsatisfied so i would not refund you as the item is not defective sorry
1702636916 Buyer: There is evidence in this chat that you already agreed to a refund as the item was not meeting my expectations and as a result, we both agreed to remove our bad reviews of each other therefore, I am a satisfied customer with this outcome.  With this outcome we are both satisfied as you have no bad reviews which means this will not affect your future customers
1702636954 Seller: I Walk Away.

1702636399 Seller: I'm sorry you were dissapointed but unfortunately the jersey you purchased does not promise a certain name therefore you are not eligible for a refund
1702636438 Buyer: Can I ask why your website referenced Kobe Bryant then please if you do not guarantee a specific person 
1702636493 Seller: My website shows what you may receive as an example but it is clear that you could receive any name
1702636564 Buyer: I find this extremely misleading and I know my rights as a customer, I can see you have since removed the reference to Kobe from your website, why would you do this if you have not made a mistake ? I will be leaving you a review and expressing my disappointment 
1702636683 Seller: I have not made a mistake, it is clear what I sell and I would appreciate if you retract your bad review otherwise I will have to leave a bad review for you

1702636368 Seller: No refund is due the item was supplied as ordered
1702636412 Buyer: I've got photo evidence that this is not the case. I can find the email with the product description which shows that you haven't supplied the correct item - this is fraud. 
1702636521 Seller: I have the full paper trail from order, to fulfilment, to shipping and delivery. You have the shirt you ordered I have your payment.
1702636607 Buyer: The paper trail will say that you delievered an item, the email confirmation I have says you delivered the wrong item. You have committed fraud here. I'm well within my rights to go to the bank and that might lead to financial consequences for your business. Not only this, but you posted a bad review on my page because I told the truth about how you were fraudulent. 
1702636690 Seller: Go on then sue me. You are in the wrong, you know you are in the wrong. 
1702636794 Buyer: I'm happy to go to the bank or we can solve this before it gets to that stage. All the evidence I have says that you provided the wrong item, so you would not have a strong case. This conversation will be evidence as well that you've yet to show any proof that you haven't delivered the wrong item. Instead, we can avoid this if you give me a full refund, retract your bad review and apoologise forhow you've acted.
1702636852 Seller: I don't even stock the item you said you ordered. That's going to look good in court!
1702636967 Buyer: I've taken photos of the description that clearly said the item was the specific footballer, not a general one. I've also taken photos after you changed the description. Either way, the bank will give me a refund on this, as I can reasonably show it's fraudulent. So either they refund me and you get investigated for fraud, or you refund me, apologise and retract your statement, and we go about our day. Either way, I get my money back. Is that what you really want? 
1702637118 Seller: You will not get a penny out of me just a pile of lawyers fees. You can't get the sport right that's going to go down well with the  judge.
1702637255 Buyer: I don't have to spend any money on lawyers, the bank will do that for me, as well as the website host. This is only a loss for you, why don't we both just walk away happy? I'm happy to return the item to you for a full refund. I just want you to remove that review on my page, it's entirely untrue. 
1702637366 Seller: I supplied what you ordered. No bank or website is going to pay for your lawyers! Good luck getting a mortgage!
1702637427 Buyer: Why are you not willing to offer a refund at all? Why are you risking bad marks on your business record? We can both walk away from this fine. 
1702637673 Seller: I have a thriving business. Giving people their money back when I have correctly fulfilled their order isn't a thing. Reviews from people who think the LA Lakers play football isn't going to sway people.
1702637886 Buyer: Like I said, if you don't give me a refund, I will just call the bank, say this was fraudulent, and they will give me that money back. Then, they will be investigating you and your business. Or, you can avoid that entirely, and just give me my refund, an apology and retract your bad review. It's not going to impact me at all, only you. I've got all the evidence that says this is fraud. I've also got all day to argue about this, I've got nowhere else to be and you just keep digging yourself a hole. I'm more than happy to submit this conversation as evidence to the people investigating you, and they won't look kindly on you insulting me all the time. So, let's just sort this out and you can walk away without any consequences.
1702638149 Seller: You got what you ordered. If you want to escalate then that is your right, it is also my right to counter that. Just wear the shirt you bought and call it a day. 
1702638269 Buyer: I've got evidence that it wasn't. You've committed a crime. Consumer protection rights are in my favour. This is not a case you can win. You have no evidence to say you supplied me with the right item, but I've got all the evidence to say you haven't, including pictures of before you changed the description, email confirmations and this conversation. Why don't you show me proof that I got what I ordered now?

1702637684 Buyer: The product listed has the name of the player on it when I ordered and I can assure you that the description on the product has been changed from your end since the time I ordered.I am sure this couldn't have been done without your knowledge. So, I need a full refund in this case.
1702637763 Seller: I can assure you that the listing was not changed and that it never stated the players name on it. I can see from your reviews that you have pulled this kind of stunt before. All sales are final so I will not be offering you a refund.
1702637883 Buyer: You are defaming me and are accusing false and baseless allegations. If this is how you treat your customers, I will have to lodge an official complaint against you and will go to any extent to get my reputation back. I am recording this allegations and be ready to face legally
1702637995 Seller: Question: if you knew that the product was not as described, why wait 2 weeks to lodge a complaint? Other sellers have had the same issue with you before. Feel free to involve the law. My review is accurate. Once again, I will remove my review if you take yours down. You still won't be getting a refund
1702638125 Buyer: I am not bothered about the review.I will continue to post negative reviews on your website because I am at the receiving end of your deception. I need to make sure that no other person suffers the wrath of you. I was busy and out on a holiday lately and couldnt respond. I have no need to explain you my case anyway,
1702638348 Seller: You are slandering my business, my livelihood and could turn customers away from my store over a mistake you made. I have proof that the listing was not changed before or after you made your purchase. I am sorry you are unhappy but this is why I encourage all customers to read the listing fully before making a purchase. All I can do is offer to remove the negative feedback I have left for you as it is not my fault you made a mistake. If you continue to press this issue I will have to involve my own legal team as slander could result in a loss of income on my end.
1702638500 Buyer: I dont mind going legally as I am no wrong at my end at any point of time. I would need a full refund because of wrong listing at your end. I have proofs as well and would likely press charges if we dont receive any sort of a mid way conculsion

1702637370 Buyer: I have checked the order confirmation, however the item received is not the item descriped on your website.
1702637483 Seller: It is the correct item, as we have them listed as general jerseys (without a player's name) and there are separate pages for specific players. The link you chose to use was for the general jersey and that's what is on your confirmation page. As all sales are final and it's not the mistake of our shop, I'm really upset that you've published such a scathing review. Please could you remove this as it's sadly your mistake on this occasion?

All sales on my site are final and was stated at purchase so unfortunately i cant offer a full refund as if i do this once i will be expected to continue to do this in the future when other buyers make a mistake. In terms of the negative review, i would be willing to remove this when you remove my bad review.
1702637950 Buyer: When I bought the item it stated on the website that it was for Bryant's jersey. $75 is a lot of money for me and the jersey is for my terminally ill nephew, who is a huge Kobe Bryant fan.

I am sorry for your situation but I cant offer a refund unless it was genuinely my mistake. If you can show me this proof i will remove the bad review and issue the refund.
1702638251 Buyer: When I made the purchase the website stated it was for a Kobe Bryant shirt, but mention of this has since been removed from the website. I have got a screenshot of the original listing so can use this as proof if I were to escalate this complaint.

1702637211 Buyer: I am happy to discuss removing the review. With that in mind, I know that the listing changed from when I initially ordered. I accept it could have been done by mistake so here's what I would propose. I receive a full refund, I remove the review and in return your remove yours of me and you apologize for the error. How does that sound?
1702637337 Seller: I understand you're upset, but i can assure you that the listing did not change. It has never been edited, and i can provide proof of this. You received the item that you bought - i appreciate you may have made a mistake and ordered the wrong item, so i am happy to remove my review of you as accidents happen. But i sold you a good quality item at the end of the day.
1702637441 Buyer: We are clearly not going to reach a resolution on the initial advert. So let's move on from that. At the moment, it's important for you that I remove my review and I am only prepared to do that if you're willing to refund my purchase. Are you willing to move ahead on that basis?
1702637585 Seller: I can provide proof that it wasn't edited - that is indisputable. I cannot offer a refund because you received exactly what you bought. How will i support my family if i provide a refund on a jersey in perfect condition,and as per the listing. i implore you to remove the bad review. i will apologise for your upset, and i hope you can do the same to me.

I will also be happy to not write a bad review against your name, if you agree to not write one about our company.

1702637451 Seller: I am willing to come to a mutual agreement where we remove each others' bad review. However, for the refund, since our website doesn't offer one, i am willing to give it to you if you pay for the return shipping costs only. The correct jersey will be sent right after.
1702637691 Buyer: I ordered a specific item, which is reflected in the confirmation of the order. Based on that, I don't think that I should have to pay any part of the return. Also, not being willing to return faulty or incorrect items is against the consumer code for purchasing, irrespective of how your website choses to phrase it. At present it does not seem that you are taking any responsiblity for the wrong item being sent, and I am not happy with that. I am prepared to take this complaint further if we are unable to resolve it through this chat. 
1702637836 Seller: It clearly states on the website that the jersey isn't specifically that of Kobe Bryant. Hence, why i am not really at fault here. I apologize if you feel that way, but as i said, i am ready to remove the bad review but can't offer a full refund, it will put us at a loss.
1702637963 Buyer: The website was amended after the order, which is not fair practise. I appreciate the apology, but the consumer code expects you to honor a purchase. If you are not willing to offer a full refund, then I will not remove my complaint. I will also add to it the details fo this conversation. I will certainly encourage people not to do business with you in future, as you are unwilling to treat your customers fairly. As the fault is yours, the costs incurred should also be yours. I should not have to pay for your error. 
1702638152 Seller: I fully understand why you think that way, even though i don't appreciate the threats. Our store has a spotless review, so you know we are honest people. Just to relieve us from this headache, i will be willing to offer a fullr efund, expecionally this time, but i expect that the review will be removed instantly and that you assume SOME responsability in this missundersstanding. An apology for the threats will be much appreicated.
1702638318 Buyer: These are not threats - they are the action I would take if we can not resolve this, so no, I am not willing to apologise for that. I did not misunderstand, so I am not taking responsiblility for that either.  However, Thank you for the offer of the full refund, and I will remove the review, and expect you to do the same.

1702637773 Buyer: As mentioned before, the delivered good is not a Kobe Bryant shirt, which is the item that I bought. If it was for myself, I would not mind. But it is for my terminally ill nephew. Can you please refund, so that I can get him the shirt that will make him smile again?
1702637857 Seller: I'm afraid as per our terms and conditions, all sales are final. The shirt you purchased was clearly listed as a generic shirt, and not a Kobe Bryant variant, so we are unable to offer a refund unfortunately. 
1702637997 Buyer: This is not what it said when I purchased it (and I already sent you the confirmation email which clearly shows a Kobe Bryant shirt was purchased). I am quite surprised that you are not even considering a partial refund. Everyone is doing it these days. I really would like to continue doing business with you. But customer satisfaction should be your key priority, no?
1702638210 Seller: I've double checked our listing and it is definitely advertised as a generic shirt. We pride ourselves on customer satisfaction and have a 100% positive feedback rating which reflects this. The only thing I could suggest is that you resell the shirt yourself and use the proceeds to purchase the shirt you wanted. Our prices are very competitive so you should have no trouble recovering the price paid. We are unable to offer a partial refund as we have fulfilled our side of the transaction.
1702638364 Buyer: How about I return the shirt, and you refund 50%. I retract my negative review, you retract yours. Win-win. It really would mean the world to my terminally ill nephew if I could get him a Kobe Bryant shirt.
1702638527 Seller: This would lead to a loss on our side, so we are unable to offer a 50% refund. As we have fulfilled all aspects of the sale, we feel that your negative feedback is unwarranted and has negatively impacted our feedback rating. I would ask that you retract your review and keep the shirt you have, I'm sure your nephew would still enjoy wearing it. Thanks

You could respond under the review and own up to the mistake made in sending jersey. That will be a better outcome. Others can then see that you respond to even bad experiences and sort the issues out.

1702638305 Buyer: That would not be a good business practice. You have sent me an incorrect item and I have informed you of the mistake. Had you sorted it in first instance, I may not have to leave a bad review. The review only portrays what happened. If customers see that you have taken my review on board and sorted the issue, then they will have confidence in your business. I can then leave you a positive review, conveying that you have sorted the issue completely.

1702637750 Seller: Thanks, I' like to resolve this too I hate anyone to be unhappy with a purchase, as I would if it were me. Do you have any other conditions related to refund, I assume you will be returning the item Or would prefer an exchange for example?
1702637856 Buyer: I am happy to return the product in the post and would like a refund please.
1702637901 Seller: That's fine, if you follow the returns procedure then I will refund upon safe receipt of the item.
1702637941 Buyer: Perfect. Thank you I appreciate it. Please could you also retract your bad review? I would really appreciate it
1702638077 Seller: Are you able to retract yours first as the tone was rather abrasive. I am happy to come to an agreement where we both retract our reviews, alternatively we could amend them with an update which does show others that things written in the heat of the moment can be taken back. Maybe that creates a good impression of us.
1702638131 Buyer: I think that sounds fair. We could both retract our reviews and correct them to say that we are both sorry for the misunderstanding and have been able to come to a resolution
1702638195 Seller: I think that would be good - my thinking was, if someone has already read the reviews, then if they disappear it can look a little shady, like maybe pressure has been put on.
1702638232 Buyer: Okay sure that makes sense
1702638267 Seller: Thank you for being very reasonable, I appreciate it. We can finalize the agreement.

1702637732 Buyer: No, this was not the case. I specifically wanted a jersey with Kobe's name on, as this was a gift for my nephew - a Kobe fan. He's very ill so this was a special gift for him.

1702638166 Seller: Good morning
1702638355 Buyer: I'm writing in regards to the Kobe Bryan jersey I purchased for my vert ill nephew. I am extremely disappointed to see that a different player's jersey was in sent lieu of the one I ordered. I can guarantee that on the listing you made, it was listed as Kobe Bryan Jersey. I have the screenshot to prove it as I was so excited to receive it knowing my nephew is such a fan. I am extremely reputable and trustworthy buyer - I have over 500 5* reviews, and that doesn't come easily. So I do NOT appreciate the false negative you have left me - it is unwarranted, unfair and most importantly UNTRUE. I demand this situation be rectified as it is totally unfair and wrong. 
1702638523 Seller: I am sorry that you are disappointed. However, I think that there must be some mistake, as there is no Kobe-Bryan Jersey on my website. I believe that the screenshot that you have provided is from another website. Unforuntately I see that you have a reputation of submitting false reviews. Please withdraw this review and apologise.
1702638644 Buyer: You have an obligation as the seller of this jersey to rectify this problem. Everything you are saying is slanderous and incorrect. I KNOW what I purchased. I wouldn't have made the purchase otherwise as my nephew only like Kobe. I request a full refund. I am fully within my rights as a consumer to request this refund and be allowed. 
1702638710 Seller: I am willing to offer a part refund as a good will gesture. However, I would request that you withdraw your bad review.
1702638945 Buyer: I request a full refund and will not be satisfied with anything less. Those are my rights. I ordered an item that was advertised, and what was advertised didn't arrive. I received something else. Also, in your earlier message you make reference to you 'seeing you have a reputation of false reviews' in regards to me - this is totally UNTRUE. Can you explain where you have seen this? As it doesn't exist. I find your review extremely damaging and totally false. So I would also request you remove the bad review of me. It is not fair. I am a buyer wanting to spend my hard earned cash with you on your site, and you lie about the situation at hand. How can people trust to buy from you? Surely you care about your reputation and giving a good service? Surely?
1702639057 Seller: I will offer you a full refund and apologise for any inconvenience that has been caused. In answer to your question I have been in contact with other sellers who have had contact with you after you brought things from their website
1702639186 Buyer: I appreciate the offer of a full refund. Thank you for doing the right thing and for apologising. That is incorrect regarding other sellers - my feedback is 100% positive. I have never had a bad experience on this site until now. Thank you for your offerings. The final thing I would ask is for you to remove your bad review of me - I think we can both agree it is untrue and unwarranted. I will be satisfied with the service then. Thank you 
1702639264 Seller: I will withdraw your bad review and process your refund straight away. Please amend your review to reflect this, thank you.

I'll return the item with the original packaging, but my main priority is getting that jersey for him. If you cannot provide that, I would like the money so I can.

1702674582 Buyer: No I specficially requested the Kobe Bryant Jersey. This is for a terminally ill relative whose favorite player was Kobe, so I wanted him specifically, not any player. If I wanted any player, I would've gone to another website.
1702674641 Seller: I was not selling player-specific jerseys. I do not believe that a misunderstanding of what the product available was requires a bad review with a personal attack. 
1702674706 Buyer: It wasn't a personal attack. As discussed, I had specific reasons for seeking a Bryant jersey, so I definitely chose that specific jersey. The bad review is necessary to show other consumers your faulty business practices. To expect all perfect reviews is unrealistic. 
1702674817 Seller: I do not expect perfect reviews, I expect honest ones. If the product listed is for a ""Lakers Jersey"" and does not have Bryant's name or number on the listing image, it is both unfair and unrealistic to believe that it will be his. 
1702674930 Buyer: As discussed, I did specifically order a Lakers jersey for Kobe Bryant. I did give an honest review because you didn't provide the product I thought I was ordering. I'm willing to agree to a 50% refund. However, you should retract that childish response to my review, as it was an honest experience with what you're providing.

1702674733 Seller: I think I'd be willing to give you a refund if you send it back unworn. But in kind, I'd appreciate you removing the bad review you left of me.
1702674803 Buyer: It is unworn. I will send it back for a refund. I'm happy to take down the bad review as well if you will do the same.

1702675717 Seller: Hello, thank you for contacting me. It looks like the right item was sent. What makes you think you received the wrong item?
1702675761 Buyer: The original listing said it was for a particular player but instead I got sent a jersey for a player I have never heard of.
1702675837 Seller: Please check the listing again as I have just done. There was no particular player mentioned so you received a generic jersey which is what I was selling. I believe you may have misread the listing the first time. I sent the item you bought so I can not accept a return.
1702675922 Buyer: I understand that listings can change but I'm sure it was for a particular player. This is for my dying nephew. Can't you at least do a partial refund? I don't make a lot of money and inflation is really hard on everyone right now.
1702676082 Seller: Actually listings can not change. Whatever it states on the listing when you bought it is what it still says now. I'm sorry for your family issues. Unfortunately, it has nothing to do with me. I have done nothing wrong in this matter so I will not be issuing a full or partial refund. 
1702676167 Buyer: Well then how about you take that extremely rude review you left me. You resorted to petty name calling. You need to remove that review and apologize to me.

1702675150 Seller: The item was what you ordered. The site did not specify it was a Kobe Bryant specific jersey, the jersey you got was what was offered.
1702675223 Buyer: if you use a picture of a kobe jersey then thats what people think they are getting. if not you would use another jersey
1702675376 Seller: I don't believe that is accurate, I didn't set out to deceive anyone. I can sympathize that you may not have read the information carefully and jumped to some conclusions, but the image was merely a sample. If it was meant to be a Kobe-specific jersey that would have been emphasized throughout the item description.
1702675516 Buyer: You may have not set out to deceive people however you also did not set out to be completely honest either. or else you would have specified that it was a sample as well
1702675712 Seller: I don't agree, I think the item description on the site was clear that it was a team jersey, not a player-specific jersey. It's impossible to anticipate every way that someone might misinterpret something. I think people in the market for a player-specific jersey would be on the lookout for clear references to the player's name, not one incidental picture. Not having any specific player's name in the text should have been enough for you or anyone else in the market for the player-specific jersey that this wasn't that type of item.
1702675989 Buyer: apparently that is not the case because it happened to me and i am sure it will happen to others. that is why i wrote a review to make sure other people dont fall for the same thing. Now i would be willing to remove my review for a refund and you can continue to sell your listing with no effects to your sales. would you be willing to do that?
1702676118 Seller: I can offer a partial refund if you edit and update your review to indicate that there was a misunderstanding on your part.
1702676301 Buyer: If you remove your review of me i will agree to that.
1702676424 Seller: That sounds acceptable to me, if you fix the problem of an inappropriate negative review being out there then there's no need to have a lingering bad review of you, either.

1702676605 Seller: I don't think I did anything wrong so I don't think there is anything for me to apologize for. I already think I'm being generous with a partial refund.
1702676752 Buyer: I also think i did nothing wrong and i do not need your apology. So why do you want that of me? 
1702676965 Seller: You did do something wrong, you posted false information that I did not supply the advertised product when I did. You made a mistake in thinking you were buying something different and then blamed me for it. If you hadn't posted the review to the entire world I could walk away without an apology, but people need to understand that I provide the merchandise that I offer on the store page. If you don't need my apology then why did you reject the deal where all the other terms were agreeable and then offered a proposal where you have to get an apology?
1702677296 Buyer: And i offered to update/retract. we never spoke about an apology so why when you sent the deal you all of a sudden reject it to add an apology. I am ok with a partial refund to represent that it was a mutual misunderstanding and if you want an apology then so do i. I dont think we are going to agree to assign blame so lets just get this done and be out of each others way
1702677375 Seller: I thought it was clear that I meant you would update the review with the acknowledgement that the problem was with what you did, ie an apology.
1702677433 Buyer: clarifying a misunderstanding is not an apology 
1702677575 Seller: An acknowledgement of fault is an apology. I didn't do anything wrong, you did. If you refuse to acknowledge that this problem was entirely caused by you making your allegations in public than there may be no way to reach an agreement. If you had started by making a customer service request maybe we could have dealt with things in a friendlier way, but instead you decided to smear my reputation to the whole world.
1702677908 Buyer: I  dont think we will reach an agreement. You are more focused on assigning blame to a customer who has bought numerous things from you that clearing up what is an obvious misunderstanding. i think my review needs to stay up so that people understand what kind of business they are dealing with
1702677934 Seller: I Walk Away.

1702677273 Seller: Was there an issue with your order?
1702677334 Buyer: There was... I bought a jersey that was listed as a Kobe Bryant jersey but got sent a random Laker's jersey. It's a gift for my sick nephew and I really need the money back to get him the jersey he wants. If you refund me I'll return the item asap so you can resell it. 
1702677409 Seller: I'm very sorry to hear about your nephew & hope he gets better soon. Unfortunately, I won't be able to issue you a refund as the listing wasn't for a specific jersey. All sales are final, I'm afraid.
1702677495 Buyer: It's true that the listing isn't currently for a specific jersey, but I know for a fact it was listed as a Kobe Bryant jersey when I purchased it as I was very careful to buy the right product. The listing was changed after I purchased, and my review reflects that. I would happily take down my review and return the product if you refund me my money. If not, I'll have to open a dispute with my bank. 
1702677636 Seller: My listing has not changed in months. I would not misrepresent the integrity of my business this way. This is clearly a misunderstanding here. I am willing to issue you a 30% partial refund if you are willing to keep the jersey you received.
1702677756 Buyer: Look, if I open a dispute with my bank they're likely going to side with me and I'll get the money back anyways. If you refund me yourself, however, I will happily remove my negative review. Otherwise I'll have to keep it up as it reflects my experience with your shop.
1702677830 Seller: OK. I will present my evidence to your bank. Enjoy the rest of your day!

1702678947 Buyer: I disagree on that one. When I purchased the jersey, it clearly stated that it was a Kobe Bryant one. It wasn't and the person I bought it for was disappointed. I feel I'm at least entitled to a partial refund if anything.  
1702679048 Seller: I understand your frustration. However, Kobe Bryant was indeed a Laker and the image of the item clearly depicted that.

1702679310 Buyer: I appreciate your understanding. The website initially described a Kobe Bryant jersey, but I received a different one. Can we please arrange a refund to resolve this issue? Thanks.
1702679389 Seller: The website description does not state that the jersey is a Kobe Bryant jersey, it is actually not advertised for any specific player. As all sales are final, I unfortunately cannot offer a refund for an issue that was not the seller's error.
1702679458 Buyer: Can we work towards a resolution, maybe with a partial refund? Thanks
1702679551 Seller: Unfortunately I must apply our store's policy consistently - since no error was made on our end, we cannot offer any refund. I can only offer my apologies over the confusion, and we will look into making the description clearer to avoid confusion.
1702679613 Buyer: Thank you for understanding. While I recognize the policy, the initial website description was crucial in my decision to purchase. Customer satisfaction and fairness are important aspects of a positive shopping experience. Can we explore a solution, perhaps a partial refund, to ensure a fair resolution for both parties? I appreciate your consideration.
1702679730 Seller: I apologize, but we cannot offer refunds if our website description was not carefully read by the buyer. The website description does not make any reference to this item being a Kobe Bryant jersey, so I can only apologize that there was confusion. We do not advertise this item as anything other than a Laker's jersey, so we cannot consider it a fair resolution to offer a refund.
1702679790 Buyer: I also have a few more concerns for a fair solution. Firstly, could you remove the negative review about me? It's important for my reputation. Secondly, keeping my review about the product helps others. Lastly, a simple apology for the mix-up would be appreciated. Can we talk about these to find a fair resolution?
1702679864 Seller: We would be happy to remove our negative review, if you would be so kind as to do the same. We are also happy to offer an apology for this experience.
1702679987 Buyer: hank you for addressing these concerns. I'm grateful for your offer to remove your negative review, and I'm willing to reciprocate. I also appreciate your apology for the mix-up with the jersey. Let's consider these steps as a resolution to the matter.

1702679458 Seller: Hello, I saw the review that you wrote about my product. I can not give you a refund at this time and it is against my store policy. You wrote that you expected a Kobe jersey, but nowhere on the product page did it mention having a player name.
1702679544 Buyer: Thank you for responding and while I can appreciate your interpretation, I can assure you when I made the purchase your website clearly showed it was to be a Kobe jersey and not just any player.  Again, I would really like a full refund of my purchase due to this error.
1702679627 Seller: Do you have proof of this? I have never put up any player name information for any product description in my store. I do not carry that item.
1702679780 Buyer: I did not take a screenshot but fully remember it was a Kobe jersey.  The reason why I am confident is because I myself am not a basketball fan, it was for my nephew who is obsessed with one player and that was Kobe.  Sadly that nephew isn't doing well, the refund will help me buy him another Kobe item elsewhere.  I would appreciate a full refund.
1702679918 Seller: I have no reason to believe you are telling the truth. Another seller has left a negative review for you too. I will report this conversation to the company site and they will be investigating your account. If you remove the negative review of my store I will not proceed with the investigation.
1702680099 Buyer: I can assure you I am a responsible buyer.  I have been on this platform for years. I normally don't tell people this but I was in a car accident a couple of years ago and lost both legs, the rest of my body has 3rd degree burns.  I am confined to a wheelchair on fixed income.  This money I spent on the Kobe jersey is money I didn't really have to spend but I was doing it for my sick nephew.  I believe love is the most important thing and that you must have family of your own and can understand that sometimes life throws us curveballs.  Please refund this purchase so that I can have a way to buy something else before it's too late.
1702680209 Seller: I can sell you another jersey and have my friend print ""KOBE"" on the back of it. It will be $65 - a real bargain. I am not, however, giving a refund.
1702680295 Buyer: Sadly my nephew is very smart and would notice that it doesn't look too real.  If you can refund me, I will take down my negative review.
1702680346 Seller: We only sell replica jerseys. The one you bought is a replica too. It is in the product description.
1702680430 Buyer: Oh goodness, I must not have noticed that detail.  Even more reason why a refund would be great for me, so that I can make a decision elsewhere.  I would not only take down my negative review but also leave you a positive review for the refund.
1702680492 Seller: Have you removed any tags on the item? Is it new and unworn? And can you pay return shipping?
1702680560 Buyer: The jersey is still wrapped in the same packaging it came in.  It is new and never worn.  I will of course pay return shipping, if you can please just refund.  And will remove my bad review and leave you a positive review for making things right.

1702680584 Seller: Usually we take things on a case by case basis but, with you leaving a bad review and not explaining to others what actually happened and blaming the store, it's hurting my business already and taking a return will further that.

I know that this may not have been the intention of your store, so I'm willing to edit my negative review in some ways; however, I cannot edit or remove the bad review until I receive a refund.

You can leave your review up, as anyone visiting my store can see from the countless perfect reviews, that yours simply is not an accurate reflection of my business.

1702681347 Seller: The description of the item did not state that it was a Kobe Bryant jersey but instead just a generic Lakers jersey. Unfortunately, it is our store policy that we do not take returns. All items are final sale. 
1702681425 Buyer: I see, but the image was clearly a Kobe Bryant shirt. This is a gift for someone with a terminal illness. Is there anything you can do?
1702681571 Seller: So sorry to hear about your friend. I also see there was a negative review left about this purchase. Would you be willing to retract your bad review? In return, I am willing to make a one time exception and give you a partial refund. Would that work for you? 
1702681665 Buyer: I am sorry about the review. I will be happy to remove it of you will grant me a full refund. 
1702681876 Seller: I appreciate that you're willing to take down the bad review. We are a small family owned business so unfortunately, I am only able to offer a partial refund at this time. Would you be willing to still consider it?  
1702682000 Buyer: Yes, I understand your point of view as well. I will accept a partial refund, and I appreciate your kind offer. May I also ask that you retract your negative review of me as well?
1702682034 Seller: Thank you! Yes, definitely will do as well. 
1702682111 Buyer: Thank you, and again, I apologize for the review, I was really upset. I appreciate your willingness to work with me.

1702722450 Seller: Hi, i think there has been some misunderstanding, as you can see from the email confirmation it was just an unnamed jersey that was ordered, maybe a mistake your end? 
1702722593 Buyer: But the advertisement clearly showed that the jersey was supposed to show Bryant's name on it. I would consider this to be misleading from your part. Especially considering the fact that you removed the misleading part after I posted my negative review.
1702722727 Seller: That just showed shirts that were available, prices said 'from'. As i have said, your email confirmation that was received straight after the order clearly states blank jersey, no personalisation, which would show no name. I can resend a copy if you wish? The bad review you have left is damaging to my business, and i feel it has just been a misunderstanding. 
1702722980 Buyer: If you are willing to resend a copy with Bryant's name on it, I am willing to delete the review. I understand that this could hurt your business but I was feeling betrayed due to your misleading advertisement. Maybe it all was a misunderstanding but you must understand that cheap tactics like this may lead to buyers writing those kind of reviews
1702723081 Seller: I can't just send a Bryant jersey as an exchange as that costs more money, twenty dollars, if you were willing to exchange and pay the extra costs yes, but otherwise i feel that is a form of blackmail. I am sorry if anything was misleading, but I have never had any other problems with anyone else. I see you have put a negative review on another site too, its a shame 
1702723419 Buyer: I am only putting negative reviews on other sites when I feel that they deserve criticism, as I have always been fair with said criticism. I do not understand why it would cost more to print a different name on the jersey when it is just a replica. In addition to this you have also commented negatively on my comment, which is hurting my reputation as a buyer. It's not considered blackmail, when I simply want a refund for a product that I am not happy with. I have the right to post negative criticism when I feel that it is justified.
1702723508 Seller: replica jerseys always cost more with a name on, that is standard practice. i dont think we are going to get anywhere. i had to comment back on your review to defend myself and my business. 
1702723828 Buyer: It is your right to defend yourself as it is my right to express when I feel cheated by a business. I would be willing to delete the review if you delete your comment and atleast give me a 60% refund.
1702723980 Seller: i cannot give a refund without the return of the jersey as it is not something that i offer. I think i will keep a record of this conversation as again, that sounds like blackmail - refund me and i will delete the negative review. thats twice you have mentioned that. if i have to take this further i will, as now i have the proof that you are trying to extort people out of money through no fault of their own
1702724385 Buyer: How can you possibly consider this blackmailing when it is simply just a bad review? I am just trying to make an offer in order to solve this predicament. If you are not willing to solve it then great. The review stays. That is my right. Simple as that. I think as an owner of a business, it should be in your interest to keep customers happy even if you ""lose"" a couple of bucks. You deleting certain aspects of your advertisement in order to hide your faults doesn't look good either. How is this not fraudity?

1702722695 Buyer: I totally understand but I especially contact with the seller 'cause I had worry about it is a replica product as well not only about the specific player. Which was correct, the jersey is a replica product and not the player I want. So I request a refund

1702722796 Buyer: look at the bigger picture, you're just doing you job I understand but this is a fraud, don't be part of it.

1702722864 Buyer: Ma man, I just explaind that I speak with the seller, not sure if it's you but if then, you corrected that it is a Kobe Jersey
1702722944 Seller: If you look again at the website it specifically states that it isn't player specific - I apologise that you misunderstood it, but a refund won't be offered. I would appreciate if you can take your negative review down too please as it's unfair that your mistake is now my problem.
1702723038 Buyer: So you referred AI more than your own brain? 'Cause I remember that we speak about it and you correct. Don't be this corrupted. If you're going to be, I'll keep my bad review, go for the law part of it. You must give me feedback in any case within 15 days or no ?
1702723138 Seller: I'll leave my review of you up then too, if you're leaving your review of me, that sounds fair right? I know you have a history of trying to con other small businesses so it's only fair to warn other people of your behaviour.

1702723324 Seller: There's no need to put things in capitals :) Again, sorry you're frustrated, but you should have checked the product description: they aren't player specific and there are no refunds.

1702724225 Buyer: The jersey itself is in good condition, but the issue is it's not the one I ordered. It was meant to be Kobe Bryant's last championship jersey, but it's for a different player entirely. My nephew, who's a huge Kobe fan, was really looking forward to this :-(
1702724308 Seller: I'm genuinely sorry to hear that but as the one you've had delivered is still in great condition, we'll be able to look at refunding it so that you can buy the one you intended to
1702724362 Buyer: I appreciate your understanding. Getting a refund would be helpful, but ideally, I'd like to receive the correct jersey instead, as it was a specific gift for my nephew who's ill. Is there a way we can ensure the right jersey gets sent ?
1702724431 Seller: Absolutely - in place of the refund I'd be more than happy to simply swap the jersey out for the Kobe one you originally intended to buy. 
1702724490 Buyer: Thank you for offering that ! To make sure we're on the same page, could we confirm the details for the exchange ? Specifically, the process and timeframe for sending back the current jersey and receiving the correct Kobe Bryant one ?
1702724568 Seller: Absolutely, that seems sensible. I'm sure you'd understand if I'd prefer to await the return of the jersey you have before sending out the Kobe Bryant one? Once we receive confirmation of it's arrival back to us I can arrange for the Kobe one to be dispatched that same day :) 
1702724617 Buyer: Absolutely ! I'm glad we're sorting out the jersey issue ! As we're resolving this positively, would you consider retracting the negative review you posted about me as well ?
1702724715 Seller: I'd be delighted to have that negative review retracted, but that review was only submitted because of the original review you'd submitted before you realised how the mix up occurred. Admittedly though, a pair of negative reviews back and forth doesn't make anyone look good! What if we both retract our respective reviews?

1702723779 Seller: Hi buyer I would love to fix this issue for you
1702723832 Buyer: Well, I ordered a Kobe lakers jersey for my ill Nephew and he was very excited about it. But when it arrived it was just a random players name on the back which did not fit the product description. I really would like a refund from you !!
1702723906 Seller: Unfortunately all sales are final and in the fine print it does state you will receive a random shirt. The shirt posted wasnt  spcifically the one you would receive
1702724013 Buyer: The thing is that the page clearly stated it was a KOBE LAKERS jersey when I ordered it, but now the page was updated with this fine print. I think this is a very bad way to deceive your customer. I will not back down without a refund because my nephew is not dying in the hospital with an Andrew Bynum jersey!!!!  Do you have any solutions?
1702724172 Seller: Well I think we just got a miscommunication here bcause I can guarantee nobody has updated the website since you bought the jersey. Also in agreeing to our terms before you finalize the purchase you agree that all sales are final. However since your nephew is dying Im willing to come with a solution that fits both of us. Meanwhile I see you have posted a very nasty review about the store so before I offer a solution which I promise you will like please remove the review and apologize for the harsh and untrue words you used.
1702724334 Buyer: I don't see how I gain anything from that solution, your selling demeanor is very deceiving and my review only highlights my terrible experience with you. I will not be silenced and get my review taken down, you also posted a bad review about me which leads to buyers avoiding me!! I demand a refund, you to retract the bad review of me, you to own up to your mistakes and apologizing like a honest salesman. What happened to ""the customer is king"". Any solution has to include one of those, I am outraged by your onesided demands
1702724685 Seller: It is not one sided at all. Im a very honest businesswoman as you can see from my other reviews I have never been accused of being unfair or had any issues. However I will apologize for responding emotionally before requesting you to remove the untrue review. I will remove the review and again I do apologize for posting it in the first place. As promised I have a good solution. Even though you agreed on the terms and the fine print was already there I can understand with your nephew dying you are under a lot of stress. Unfortunately KOBE jerseys are all sol out. Bu I can offer a signed ball with autographs of the current LAKERS roster, 20% discount on one future purchase and a small care package for your nephew to enjoy. In return I really need you to remove the review and lets just agree that it was a miscommunication. I hope this solution is to your satisfaction.
1702724892 Buyer: I am glad you could compromise on some stuff but referring to my review as ""untrue"" is quite petty still. I accept your apology and appreciate you removing the bad review of me. I will delete my bad review of you after a satisfactory solution is found regarding the product. I don't believe my Nephew would care much about a signed ball, he really wanted his jersey. Are there any Lebron or Anthony Davis jerseys left? I;m sure that would cheer him up!! 
1702725038 Seller: I will swap the ball for a SIGNED Davis jersey and am happy we could resolve this. I would love for you to also take some accountability and apologize for calling me a crook and a thief this hurt my feelings on a personal level as this is never my intentions. I hope your nephew has a peaceful passing when the time comes and wish your family strength in dealing with this.
1702725199 Buyer: I want this ordeal to reach it's conclusion and will be delighted with a SIGNED AD jersey!! As promised, we will both delete the nasty reviews we wrote about each other. I was delighted to receive your apology and glad to hear your support for my poor nephew. I sadly can't get over the way (I felt) I was treated during this process and have no intention to apologize. I'm just glad we could work past this and I hope that future customers will not encounter the same issues I did, your pricing and products are top-notch!! 
1702725318 Seller: Lets conclude indeed. But please keep in mind calling someone such harsh words beforehand without first trying to solve things is not a nice thing to do. Thank you for removing the review and Im ahppy you are happy. Thank you for the compliment regarding our products and pricing. Have a lovely day.

1702724376 Seller: And what's your reason for refunding ?
1702724439 Buyer: The shirt that I bought for my terminally ill Kobe Bryant fan is not actually his shirt. I received a generic Lakers' shirt. It specifically stated on the website that it was a Bryant shirt which was false advertisement.
1702724566 Seller: Our website specifically states that the shirt is a replica and doesn't mention anything about Kobe Bryant. Therefore we can't offer you a refund.
1702724638 Buyer: Your website did in fact mention Bryant and then it was removed from the website. What is your refund policy? I find this incredibly bad practice as a business and I will escalate this if compensation is not made.
1702724877 Seller: Usually the sales are final and we only offer refund in cases of damages upon receiving the product. Also I saw your review of our website and I posted my review of you as a buyer to keep the whole situation transparent.
1702724949 Buyer: I would like the review removed. I have only wrote an honest review and I would have not sent out any kind of review if I had a good experience. To prove this, I do not need a refund as money is not the issue, but I would like the bad review retracted. I was telling the truth.
1702725133 Seller: Since I already posted the review, it is impossible for me to remove as I want to inform other customers, who might also be confused about our products. However, you can still choose to remove your review of the purchased product.
1702725230 Buyer: It's not impossible for you to remove it, you just don't want to. If you don't remove the review I will consult my attorney. I am also a member of several e-commerce buyer groups and will continue to post negative reviews on social media platforms if the review is not removed. This isn't me asking for a refund, and slander is no way to treat your buyers who have bought from you and given you money.
1702725449 Seller: As I have mentioned, I posted my review to keep the whole situation as transparent as possible and not to slander you or make it personal. I believe, you owe me your apology for further complicating this situation more than needed.
1702725485 Buyer: I will not apologize and I am going to report you to the authorities. I hope you realize you have just ruined the reputation of your company.

1702726002 Buyer: I cannot remove my negative review as my review is accurate. you purposely stated you had an item for sale for a specific player and when you sent the wrong item changed the details on the website. I am sure that I will be able to take this further as you have committed fraud and I know there will be legal avenues I can take and there will be evidence through techical means of proving you did this if I cannot get a refund. so can you please refund my money and I will remove the bad review as a compromise
1702726178 Seller: I'm sorry that you feel that way but I can assure you no descriptions have been changed and that we are not in the business of defrauding. I am looking at your proposal but I have some sticking points: 1. Other customers will have already seen your review which is damaging to our business and 2. If I refund you what's stopping everyone else from doing the same thing? I appreciate mistakes do happen but I would be most grateful if you could see this issue from my perspective.
1702726351 Buyer: How about if instead of removing the bad review, the review remains and we leave the context instead, replies showing that the issue was a misunderstanding and that a refund was made on this occasion as a gesture of goodwill. Then I will get a refund and any other customers will see this was a one off and the context of the issue. it will also reflect positively on you as business that any issues can be resolved
1702726522 Seller: Ok but you still have to recognise that the review will have already been damaging to our business. If we want to demonstrate that there was a misunderstanding how about I kindly ask that you remove your bad review, as I will remove the bad review of yourself as a buyer, you write a small apology review explaining the misunderstanding and that I do offer you a refund as a gesture of goodwill as you say? I hope that would satisfy both parties?
1702726752 Buyer: If you are willing to offer the refund and remove the bad review of me then I would be willing to compromise and write a small apology review on this occasion and remove my bad review. I do however want to make it clear to you that i still believe that I have not made a mistake and am doing this to resolve the issue as my relative I am buying this for is very ill and I want to get them a replacement to cheer them up.

We want to ensure our customers have accurate information, and we're here to help.
1702729317 Buyer: No, you stated the jersey was for Kobe Bryant. I need a kobe bryant's jersey for my sick cousin. I wouldn't get just any lakers jersey. It is personal, it has to be Kobe bryant's jersey. That was why I bought it in the first place
1702729416 Seller: We understand your disappointment, and we want to address your concerns. However, our policy states that all sales are final. We work hard to provide transparent product descriptions, and we want to make sure our customers are aware of what they're purchasing.
1702729487 Buyer: Well, I need my money back. I have to get that jersey for my sick cousin one way or another.
1702729609 Seller: We genuinely apologize for any misunderstanding. We value your satisfaction and want to make things right. As a gesture of goodwill, we'd like to offer you a full refund for your purchase. If we process the refund, would you consider updating your review to reflect the resolution and any positive aspects of our customer service?
1702729713 Buyer: That would be fine. I would update my review after an apology . Because I was really pained and my sick cousin is still feeling sad, the jersey would have really helped boost up his mood.
1702729786 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller did apologize, and buyer did apologize.

1702755828 Seller: It was not suppose to advertised to have the name Kobe Bryant on it. Sorry for any confusion. Since we dont have the jersey you are looking for we can do a refund. we would just like to ask first if you have already left a negative review about this transaction or not? 
1702755924 Buyer: Thanks a refund will be appreciated in that case. Regarding the review, I did leave a negative one since the description was clearly changed right after.
1702756055 Seller: Yes we changed it in order to correct the mistake and know we are trying to fix this mistake by offering a refund. however we cant offer a refund to someone who reviewed are company so negatively. remove the review and we will sent the refund

I am requesting a refund.
1702755721 Seller: Oh, I am so sorry to hear that! I am very happy to help, but I was wondering if you read the privacy policy of the store before purchasing?
1702755844 Buyer: Are you referring to the no refund policy? I understand that sales are final however I did not agree to just any Lakers Jersey. I specifically asked for a Kobe Bryant Jersey. I have very ill relative that is expecting this specific Jersey and it would mean a lot to them if they received it. If the Kobe Bryant Jersey cannot be delivered, I feel that as a seller you should do what is right, and provide a refund please.
1702755964 Seller: I am sorry, but on the wesbite the information was provided very well. As a purchaser, you should have read and paid attention to what you wanted. In addition, this item was on final sale, which means that unfortunately there is no refund for this. 
1702756143 Buyer: But your ad was modified after the sale, and I have proof as I have the invoice that specifically states that this is supposed to be for a Kobe Bryant Jersey. This type of transaction from your end is not ethical, the review you left to me wasn't true as well. I had also left a review on your profile indicating my concerns about this transaction. Perhaps we can reach a mutual deal. If you provide a refund, we can both edit our reviews indicating the matter is now resolved, and we can both apologize to each other and move on?
1702756284 Seller: I could offer a refund, but I will not delete my review. However, if you want the refund, you should delete your review. How does that sound?
1702756485 Buyer: For me to remove or modify my review, It would be fair for you to also do the same. I understand your policy now moving forward but I think there is a 50/50 split in blame as the ad was modified after my purchase to indicate the Jersey wouldn't necessarily be Kobe's. If you agree to remove your review, process a refund (I will return the jersey to you) and we can both apologize to each other like professionals I think this is a fair resolution for both parties. Do you agree?
1702756604 Seller: I do not have much time now, so I agree with you. But please dont blame me for editing the ad after purchase. 
1702756691 Buyer: Ok - thank you for your understanding. And yes I apologize for blaming you for modifying the ad. I hope that we can do business again in the future.

1702756226 Seller: Nowhere did it say it was of a specific player, it was a general jersey. The website clearly states this.
1702756258 Buyer: The website clearly indicated the purchase was for Bryant’s jersey. 
1702756334 Seller: I'm sorry for the misunderstanding this has caused. The jersey is not meant to be of a specific player at all. We may not offer a refund due to this being a final sale.

I would be happy to remove my review if you agree to a refund in order for me to buy my sick nephew the jersey he wants.
1702756717 Seller: This is a frustrating situation for both of us. I unfortunately cannot offer refunds. The ad clearly states all sales are final and I cannot go against that policy. My hands are tied on that. But we can both revoke our negative reviews of each other.
1702756926 Buyer: I did notice that the initial ad mentioned Kobe Bryant upon initial purchase, however, once my negative review went up, the details of the ad had changed. I am glad you changed the ad in order to correctly represent your product, but I do have a screenshot of the initial ad and this would indicate misrepresentation of your product. For this, I know your policy and read it well, misrepresentation is ground for a full refund. Once you provide a refund, I will be happy to revoke my negative review. 
1702757141 Seller: The listing details were never altered at any time, and it never stated that this was a Kobe Bryant jersey - only that it was a Laker's jersey. There was no misrepresentation and I am unable to provide a full refund, and will not take down my negative review of you unless you remove your review. 
1702757388 Buyer: The negative review is accurate based on my experience with the purchase and our conversation thus far. I do not believe your hands are tied and am open to negotiations with you however, it seems you are only interested in keeping the money, removing the bad review, and are unable to help your customers in anyway. I will not take down my review. 
1702757591 Seller: I am willing to help by removing my bad review of you. I cannot offer a refund because our transaction was legitiment and I cannot be responsible for an error that you made while purchasing. My ad was clear and I apologize that you are in this situation. I suggest we walk away from this.
1702757668 Buyer: The ad was clearly altered and you refusal of admission is very clear. We both know there is no help being offered here. I agree to walk away
1702757692 Seller: I Walk Away.

1702757735 Seller: I understand your point of you but the add stated that products needed to be selected based on your preference. I cannot possibly post an add with all players items in one picture. I understand that we are both at fault as you find my add was misleading, but that you didn't take the time to actually read the writings on the add.
1702757833 Buyer: Then you should only post an image without the number and the last name of the player, not advertising it with one of the most popular player in the world. As I said, I will change my review if I get full refund on the item.

1702757172 Seller: Okay, in that case, I will be offering a full refund
1702757220 Buyer: Thanks. I also would like to request that you take down the bad review of me. I did leave you a negative review, but that is because my experience was poor

1702757188 Seller: Hi there, may I ask why you're requesting a refund?
1702757237 Buyer: Of course! The jersey I got was not a Kobe jersey as your site indicated. I ordered it for my sick nephew, so I really need to get him the right one. :)
1702757295 Seller: I'm sorry to hear that you weren't able to get the gift your nephew was wanting. However, it is clearly stated on our website that the jerseys are not for a specific player. 
1702757372 Buyer: When I ordered the jersey it did specify that it was Kobe and I have proof. I am not trying to be difficult and that's why I hope to get a refund to resolve this for us both.
1702757511 Seller: I'm unsure where you saw the message saying it was specifically a Kobe jersey. I can direct you to the link where it clearly states that the items are not for a specific player. 
1702757588 Buyer: The wording on the website has been changed. I don't want to waste our time here, and I am willing to remove my review if you refund the jersey and remove your review about me. I am really just trying to do right by my nephew. :) 
1702757684 Seller: Sure, I understand. I appreciate you offering to remove your negative review. If you do so, I will offer you a partial refund and remove my review as well. 
1702757754 Buyer: Would it be possible to do a full refund? I am returning the jersey and we both take our reviews down. I am sorry for how this has transpired, but I want to resolve it in a fair and quick way, as I'm sure you do too.
1702757818 Seller: I'm on the same page as you. I'll offer a partial refund and allow you to keep the jersey. How does that sound?
1702757868 Buyer: I really don't have use for the jersey and I've kept the tags on. I can ship it back and pay shipping for a full refund. Does that work?
1702758001 Seller: We aren't able to resell items that have been returned even with tags on. I'm offering you a partial refund while being able to keep the jersey. As I mentioned earlier, it is very clearly communicated on our website that the items are not for a specific player. I feel that we have done everything we need to do on our end to make things clear for our customers. 
1702758152 Buyer: I do have proof that it was changed, and again, want to resolve this between us. I can also submit this through a formal channel for meditation in which I think you will see your selling page on this site be removed. I am being more than fair here and my offer stands at a full refund and both reviews down. Otherwise, I will be reporting this and take the loss. Let's resolve this together now.

1702758300 Seller: That would be dishonest of you. it is reasonable that there is more than one picture per page; you have to pay attention to the descriptor for what you are ordering.I have also spoken to other owners who use the same sales sit as us, and warned them against letting you purchase from them.

And return the order.
1702758589 Seller: I will not be refunding the order as all of my sales are final. However, in exchange for a positive review, I will send you a Kobe Bryant jersey and retract my review of you as a buyer. You can keep the other one and do whatever you like with it.
1702758795 Buyer: Either send me a full or partial refund or  I will be taking this to court on counts of fraud and deceptive marketing, I will call my bank and do all within my power to try and squander this because this left a really poor taste in my mouth with how this whole situation occurred, all sales are final does not mean refunds cant be issued, especially if its on the count of false marketing.
1702758912 Seller: I am offering you the product you intended to order for no additional charge, plus letting you keep the product you ordered on accident. You can certainly try to take it to court, but I'm quite confident that my marketing is not deceptive.

1702757493 Seller: Sure, let's work something out! What is the issue with the jersey?
1702757665 Buyer: My nephew is a big fan of Bucky (sorry for not remembering the exact name, not a native speaker) and he is dying to get it. And I saw the description and felt so excited about the deal. However, the jersey delivered is actually for LA lakers, which my nephew doesn't want. He has been unwell for so many days and I am really trying to cherry him up by buying a right jersey, therefore I wonder if you would be so kind to issue the refund.

1702759571 Seller: Alright, I will go ahead and fully refund you first. The Kobe Bryant jersey will be shipped out today in an expedited package. Can you please remove the negative review you left me?
1702759645 Buyer: I appreciate. I will not remove the negative review, instead I will put an update how this matter resolved for transparency.
1702759873 Seller: That's fine, I guess. I will retract my negative review for you as the issue has been resolved and you have been patient with me.
1702760023 Buyer: Thank you, that's totally fine.
1702760098 Seller: Okay, is there anything else I can help you with, or any other questions you have?

1702757676 Seller: Hello. I could if you issue an apology.
1702757711 Buyer: why would i apologize?
1702757789 Seller: Due to you bad comment regarding my store which is not true as stated at the description, you are buyer a non-player specific jersey but you were expecting to get Kobe's jersey. You then posted a bad review regarding my store.
1702757858 Buyer: I know that the ad specified Kobe as it is for my terminally ill nephew. I wouldn't have purchased if it did not say Kobe specifically
1702757944 Seller: First, sorry about your nephew. As for the item, you probably didn't read it correctly. You could even go back online and see you email for the item you've purchased. You will clearly see that the jersey is not for 'Kobe' thus making your claims false.
1702757993 Buyer: Do you have a Kobe jersey? If you are able to send me one then I will remove the review and we can move on from this
1702758130 Seller: As stated online, it's a Lakers jersey - no player specific ones. I have seen your other reviews as well and it's seems like this is a trend for you just in order to claim 'refund' you falsely accuse the store owners which I believe should stop that's why I've issued you a bad review - to open other store-owner's eyes as this is our livelihood. We need to be honest.
1702758288 Buyer: Go check my reviews again, clearly you were looking on the wrong profile. I actually have only good reviews. Nice try though. I don't want a refund so that's not why I am doing this. I am only asking for you to remove my review. I will remove mine and we can move on. I will have to find another jersey for my newphew somehow hopefully before his illness gets to bad 
1702758562 Seller: If you are not asking for refund, why is the title of the chat/email says 'Refund'? Clearly, you're lying here and trying to manipulate me just now. I don't mind but an apology needs to come first if you want me to remove my review about you. What's your move?
1702758758 Buyer: At first yes I did want a refund as I can't really afford to spend 75$ on something I am not receiving. I wanted to use the refund to try to purchase a new jersey as I had promised my nephew this. If you are able to send a Kobe jersey, I will send this one back to you, remove the review and issue an apology to you. My only concern now is making sure my nephew is happy in his last days. I hope you understand
1702759092 Seller: Oh dear. As stated on my store's website, there's only non-player jersey for Lakes. If you didn't catch it earlier, it means there's no Kobe jersey and no refunds will be issued. You then post a bad review and upon checking your profile, it's been concluded that you have been doing this even before in order to get sympathy to get a refund. This cheating and lying will not slide for me that's why I've given you a bad review as well so other company would know your 'refund-operation'.
1702759279 Buyer: Ok, can you issue me a refund? I will issue an apology and remove the review. I have not done this before, my reviews are not even close to what you are saying. I would like you to remove mine but again, keep it up if it means I can still get a new one from somewhere else in time for my nephew. You must have some sort of refund policy and I believe I fall into the time frame for such. So please, allow me to apologize, remove your review and receive the refund simply so that I can fufill my last promise to my nephew
1702759701 Seller: If you read the website, because we are a small online store, it says we have no-refund/no-exchange policy. Meaning, I cannot issue you a refund. When purchasing, you would have been asked/prompted if you're sure about buying the specific item/s because there will be no refund/exchange. Since you did click/buy the item, it is a final sale. As for the review, if you want me to take down my bad review for you, please issue an apology, retract your comment and I will remove my bad comment of you. Thanks.
1702759794 Buyer: I understand the policy, considering the circumstances would you consider a partial refund?? I will retract my review and issue the apology. 
1702759877 Seller: No refund means no refund meaning no partial refund as well. Please read the policy once more.

1702758560 Buyer: No, unfortunatly it is not what I recieved.
1702758682 Seller: I see. Well if you can send back the jersey you received with the tag still attached we can get you a refund. However, if it is not a product from our inventory no refund will be submitted.

Although, we did ship the Kobe Bryant Replica Jersey to you initially so you probably will not receive a refund. We apologize if something happened during shipping. However, we are not responsible for the item after it is shipped and properly packaged.

1702758387 Seller: Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that. let's try to fix this problem for you. Can you please describe the item that you received and what you were expecting to get?
1702758553 Buyer: I was supposed to recieve Jersey by this certain basketball player that was listed in the title of the item listing. It seems that someone had recently changed the title so that it doesn't list that specific Jersey anymore and just lists the basketball teams name.
1702758747 Seller: I looked into your order number and reviewed the listing for the item that you purchased. The item in the order is for an LA basketball jersey with no player on it. Unfortunately we don't sell jerseys with player names on the back. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
1702758830 Buyer: I have the reciept in my email that says otherwise.
1702758969 Seller: Unfortunately that's impossible because we don't sell that particular item here. Is it possible that you were browsing other stores and saw that item in another shop? We are a small business and only sell a small selection of blank jerseys. Our records are showing that you received a blank LA jersey. Can you confirm if that's the one that you received? 
1702759040 Buyer: I will see... hmm it seems that it was.
1702759174 Seller: Thank you for confirming. Yes, then you received the correct item because we only sell blank jerseys in our store.
1702759203 Buyer: Is there a way to recieve a refund?
1702759279 Seller: No, I'm sorry but that's not possible. We are a small business and our store policies state that all sales are final. Please see the listing for the item that you purchased [link here]. As you can see, this policy is written in bold under the product description. 
1702759354 Buyer: Do you do any other services so I could make the jersey look like it's from a specific player or personalize it?
1702759477 Seller: Unfortunately I don't offer that. However, I'm sorry to hear that you aren't completely satisfied with your order. Our customers are important to us and it's important to us that we meet your expectations. We'd like to offer you a resolution to make up for the fact that you are not fully satisfied. I can reimburse you 15% and your shipping costs. This should be enough for you to get another business to put the player's name on the jersey. In return, could you please erase the review you left on my store calling me a ""liar and a crook?""
1702759657 Buyer: Yes to the reimbursement and taking down my review, in return that the person who gave me a bad review to edit theirs that we both apologize and we are now on better terms as buyer and customer due to misunderstandings.

1702759136 Buyer: I feel you owe me an apolgy and refund for false advertising and a negative review for me when I have done nothing but buy a product from you that was false advertising.  
1702759280 Seller: Mistakes happen in processing and the wrong item was sent. You jumped the gun and made accusations about my business in a public forum before asking me about it.  I would consider your actions false when you clearly know now that it was a mistake.

1702759389 Seller: Im so sorry about that. From my records, I can see that the order you placed did not specify the type of jersey you would get, but that it would be at random. Thus, it was not specified that you would receive a Kobe jersey. For this reason I cannot issue a refund at this time.

Nevertheless, we will also retract our review and process your refund. Next time, please contact us before putting up a review that other customers can see!

1702759491 Seller: Well, I think we can come to an arrangement about our reviews, but if I offer you a refund, I'll have to give every single person a refund who just doesn't like their product. It's an easy way for people to scam me if I do that.
1702759709 Buyer: I understand that,  but this is extenuating circumstances since the product was incorrectly.  In addition to removing the bad review, I'll also leave a glowing review.  That will definitely look a lot better for both of us.  The item was never worn and completely perfect for resale.  I understand mistakes happen and this one is very easy to correct.
1702759860 Seller: Instead, I'm ok with just leaving it at taking our reviews off, instead of leaving a glowing review. I actually don't do this normally, but I can offer you a partial refund. I wouldn't be comfortable with us leaving glowing reviews for each other, considering that's not the reality.
1702760009 Buyer: Fair enough on the review part.  How about we just remove them altogether then?  What amount of partial refund are you thinking of?
1702760117 Seller: I think half of the cost seems fair. But we can hammer the exact number after we finalize the deal on here.
1702760298 Buyer: How is you getting the product back to resell and and me basically just losing out on 40 bucks fair?  I was thinking more along the lines of 90 percent.  Would give you a 10 percent restocking fee.
1702760348 Seller: I Walk Away.

1702759801 Seller: This jersey has been sold for a long time and the information has never changed. I believe you must have confirmed it before buying it, so I will not make any refunds.
1702759898 Buyer: I am sorry to hear that. I guess I will have to post my review on your web page along with the screen shot so people can see that I was telling the truth and that you are selling product that is not what it is advertised as. This may have a huge inpact on your future sales.

1702760089 Buyer: This jersey was for my terminally ill nephew. I will be sure to mention in my review this fact and that your company appears not to have a heart or care about anything else but money. I'm sure this will make your company very peopular.
1702760166 Seller: Sorry
1702760262 Buyer: So what dose sorry mean. Are your going to give me a refund. If you do, I will notpost a negative review. In fact, I will post a very positive review saying that people should deal with you because you are a company with a heart..
1702760277 Seller: I'm sorry to hear this, but business is business and everyone has a family to support. From my standpoint, if your nephew really needs that jersey, if you can choose one that you think is suitable in my store, I can give you a suitable discount. This is all I can do. .
1702760317 Buyer: What is a suitalb discournt?
1702760506 Seller: Since you care about discounts, I believe what you are saying is true. First of all, I need to confirm that what you said is true. You need to provide all the necessary materials to prove your statement, and then we will discuss the discount; if you cannot provide it, then I think you are a shameless liar who is using the health of your family to Lie, I will go to your account and explain everything.
1702760642 Buyer: Ok, if that is the way you feel, I will post my review immediatley along with the screen shot of your page and the Koby jersey you were advertising. This should make your company extremely popular, unless you would like to give the refund. Since you have already apologized, the refund would be appropriate at this point.
1702760784 Seller: That apology is for your nephew, not you. I also have screenshots. I believe everyone can judge who is the person who uses the health of his family to bargain. Such people do not deserve an apology from anyone. No refunds, this is my final response.

1702760018 Seller: Hello, thank you for reaching out. Unfortunately, we don't offer refunds and all sales are final. Is there another way I might be able to assist you? 
1702760101 Buyer: The product was different than advertised. Is a partial refund possible?
1702760227 Seller: Thank you again for letting us know of your issue. Can you state how the product was different than advertised? Also, as stated on our website, we unfortunately do not offer partial refunds either. 
1702760300 Buyer: The product in question was said to be a Kobe Bryant Lakers jersey, however, when we received the product, it was a jersey for a different player on the team. We were expecting to receive a Kobe Bryant jersey and unfortunately did not get that. 
1702760407 Seller: Thank you again for letting us know your issue. We are very sorry to hear this. If you look at our website, you will see that it states we only offer Los Angeles Lakers jerseys without names and numbers on them. 
1702760465 Buyer: The product was not advertised that way though, it was clearly advertised as being a Kobe Bryant jersey with his name and number on it. This was then changed when I made a complaint. 
1702760633 Seller: Again, we're very sorry that you were under this impression. We have always stated on our website that we do not offer jerseys with names and numbers on them, as we don't want to mislead others or end up with unfortunate situations like this.  
1702760734 Buyer: If you cannot offer me a refund, please reinstate my review so that others can be aware before making their purchases. I posted a review expressing my disappointment with the purchase, and the review was subsequently taken down and I was insulted and ridiculed.  
1702760856 Seller: It is up to you whether to keep your review of us up or not. We would very much appreciate to not have a negative review from you due to your unfortunate experience with us. 
1702760961 Buyer: The review was taken down on your end. If you cannot provide me with a refund, then reinstate the review. 
1702761203 Seller: Thank you very much. We can reinstate the review, but please be aware that we will have to post our own review of you as a buyer to clarify to other potential buyers that the misunderstanding stems from your misunderstanding of our website - which again, clearly states we do not offer jerseys with names and numbers on them. We hope you can understand. 
1702761250 Buyer: I believe an apology is in order from you lot as well.
1702761397 Seller: We absolutely apologize to you for your experience. We value your business as a buyer and would like to keep it despite this unfortunate experience. Again, we're very sorry that your expectations were not met in your interaction with us. 
1702761457 Buyer: I appreciate the apology. In exchange for me keeping up my review, you may keep up your review of me.

1702760444 Seller: We have never sold Kobe Jerseys. We sent you the item you selected.
1702760548 Buyer: ive got nothing but time, my nephew life is what matters, i want a refund, retraction of review, and an apology, doesn't matter who is right or wrong what matters is a happy customer, the amount of social media you will see becuase you can't give up a few dollars. i can stay all day 
1702760627 Seller: Look, all I can offer is a partial refund if you remove the bad review.
1702760742 Buyer: nope , if it were any other case sure id give leeway, but my nephew is dying. DYING. he could die tomorrow and his death will just be dollar signs to you, i'm willing to apologize if you refund, retract your review and apologize. lets just get this done and over with and save each time
1702760999 Seller: If your nephew really needs a Kobe Jersey to survive, you are free to purchase it wherever you want. Loosing a bad customer does not matter to me. Mine is a local business, and if I were to offer a refund to anyone who asked very rudely, I would loose my income. As I said, my final offer is a partial refund for removing the bad review.

1702760365 Buyer: The product I purchased does not align with the product I received. I also see that the listing from which I purchased has been changed. However, I am dissatisfied with this purchase and I want a refund.
1702760422 Seller: While I'm sorry you are dissatisfied, the listing was not altered in any way. Perhaps you had read it wrong to begin with?
1702760500 Buyer: I did not read it wrong. I remember clearly that this product was a Kobe Bryant jersey rather than a random Lakers jersey. In fact, the email receipt I received lists it as such. However, I can see that when I click the product link from my email receipt, it takes me to this updated product listing that does not mention player. Regardless of what the listing says now, I am positive that when I made the purchase it was specifically for Kobe Bryant. I want a refund or an exchange for the correct player.

I'd like to discuss the jersey and the way you handled the situation, which was completely unprofessional and uncalled for. I'd like a refund and an apology for your actions and for you to remove the negative review you gave me on the website.
1702766294 Seller: I don't believe that it's fair for you to receive a refund - you received the item that you purchased, it's not my responsibility to take the blame for you failing to read the details of the item. I'd like for you to apologize for placing a blemish on my business, and I'm willing to retract my negative review if you retract yours.
1702766382 Buyer: I don't think I should remove my negative review when it's only there to warn other customers about what happened. You changed the item's description after the fact and tried to cover it up, so I don't think I should remove my review.
1702766472 Seller: That's simply not true - and your attitude is precisely why I'm not going to give you everything you want. Other stores have reviewed you negatively as well, you have a history of trying to cheat the system like this.
1702766668 Buyer: The jersey was $75 and was not what I paid for. I had a good standing on this website and regardless of other websites, the fact still remains that I bought a Kobe Bryant jersey and received one for another player I've never even heard of.
1702766769 Seller: You bought a mystery jersey, and got mad that you didn't receive the best option. That's not grounds to throw a fit like this. The only thing I'll offer is a retraction of my bad review in exchange for the retraction of your review. I'm willing to look past your mistake, and keep both of our reputations intact - otherwise there is no deal.
1702766905 Buyer: Even though it was such a waste of money, I'm willing to overlook the refund, but I don't want to retract my negative review warning others of the way you handled this situation. If anything, your denial proves that it was needed even more so than I thought.
1702766925 Seller: I could say the same to you - no deal, then.

1702894757 Buyer: The only solution is then that you remove the bad review of me and formally apologize
1702894798 Seller: I will not remove the bad review as it is what I believe, however I can write a formally apology that is justifiable 
1702894870 Buyer: An apology means that you think what you previously wrote was wrong, hence you should remove the bad review. I can retract my bad review of you if you both apologize and remove the review
1702894952 Seller: If we both remove our bad reviews then the apology has no meaning because there is nothing for others to see what I am apologizing for. Perhaps I can delete mine but you also have to post the review to clarify that you now understand items are non-refundable even if there was a mistake 
1702895080 Buyer: Agreed then, you'll remove you bad review and I'll clarify that I understand that even if there is an actual mistake the items are non-refundable

1702895827 Buyer: I only can remove the review on my end if I get the refund as I purchased someone else than what I got. I sent you the photo and now you can compare them. 
1702895961 Seller: We compared the images and detected a mistake caused by the warehouse and delivery. This means that our advertisement was not misleading. We will refund you as soon as you remove your review.
1702896023 Buyer: Thank you very much for your time and effort.
1702896061 Seller: I can still display your review. Could you remove it so that I can transfer the refund?
1702896098 Buyer: I told you I will remove the bad review after I got my refund and not before.
1702896148 Seller: Then the refund will not be realised since you are misleading our customers.
1702896199 Buyer: I am not misleading the customers as you not sending the right product and you are refusing to give a refund which is against the law.
1702896344 Seller: We have rights to protect our reputation and trustworthiness against misinformation. We possess the right to be compensated against possible harm to our business. By the law, we have the right to hold the refund as long as our business is harmed by a conflict!
1702896490 Buyer: That is fine. See you on court! Because you only can claim those rights if that is true. Unfortunately on this occasion you sent the wrong product and the proof is this chat and that means you legally have to refund my money as this item I received is not the one you advertise online. Which means you are scamming people.

1702896597 Buyer: I take you to court if I do not get refund. You clearly never heard about buyer protection.

1702895559 Seller: Sorry but that is the case, we have fulfilled a lot of these shorts before and never had any complaints except for yours
1702895661 Buyer: I'm sorry but I went through the reviews you have received and this is incorrect. It looks like the same mistake has been made before. All I'm asking is to kindly allow me to return this product and receive the one I bought please.
1702895732 Seller: Unfortunately I can't do that because it would set a wrong precedent for the future where people would expect refunds where we clearly state that we can't offer a refund.
1702895783 Buyer: Let's rule out the refund here please. I'd suggest to have the item replaced as I need it as a gift.
1702895848 Seller: Okay, I can replace the item. Might I suggest that we both remove the negative reviews as well?

1702896171 Seller: I'm sorry that the item you received was not what you expected, of course that's not what we want. I looked into the item that you purchased, and we do not advertise it as a Kobe Bryant jersey though - only as a Lakers jersey. The item photo also does not mention the Kobe Bryant name..

1702896347 Seller: i accept returns if the items isnt as described but unfortunately in this case the shirt is as it states in the description. i will not be able to refund in this case, i do apologise for the misunderstanding and id be happy to retract my review if you will either retract yours or apologise on the review as in this case ive sold a top correctly and unable to refund

1702896247 Seller: Hello, thanks for reaching out to me regarding this issue! Unfortunately, as it states in our terms and conditions on our website, this did not state anything particular of a specific player and it was only a service to sell general jerseys. I can offer a refund but it would be a partial one. Would that suffice? 
1702896362 Buyer:  I appreciate your attention to this matter. Receiving the wrong item has not only caused inconvenience but also deviated from the expectations set by the order. I believe a full refund would be the most equitable resolution in this situation. I'm more than willing to return the incorrect item promptly to expedite the process. Your understanding and cooperation in providing a complete refund would go a long way in ensuring customer satisfaction. Thank you for your consideration.
1702896444 Seller: Thank you for your understanding and willingness to return the incorrect item. I appreciate your cooperation in resolving this matter.

I am willing to offer you a full refund for the jersey, but I would still like to request that you remove the negative review you left for me. I believe that removing the negative review would be fair and equitable, as it would allow me to address the issue directly with you and ensure that future customers are not misled by your inaccurate claim.

I would also like to apologize for any inconvenience or disappointment this situation may have caused you. I take pride in providing my customers with accurate product descriptions and a positive shopping experience, and I regret that this issue did not meet your expectations.

I hope that you will reconsider removing the negative review. I believe that it would be a fair and reasonable compromise that would allow us to resolve this dispute amicably.

Please let me know if you are willing to consider this proposal.
1702896622 Buyer: 
Thank you for your understanding. I greatly appreciate your prompt action in issuing the refund. As a gesture of goodwill, I'll make sure to remove my review. Thank you once again for resolving this matter efficiently.
1702896695 Seller: Thank you for your willingness to remove the negative review. I sincerely appreciate your cooperation in resolving this matter.

In exchange for your removal of the negative review, I would like to offer you a partial refund of $45 for the jersey. This would still allow you to receive a significant portion of your purchase price back, while also ensuring that I am able to maintain my reputation as a trustworthy seller.

I believe that this partial refund is a fair and equitable compromise that would allow us to both reach our desired outcomes. It would give you some financial compensation for the inconvenience you experienced, while also allowing me to protect my reputation and avoid future disputes.

I hope that you will consider this proposal. I am confident that we can reach an agreement that meets both of our needs.

Thank you for your understanding.
1702896779 Buyer: Haven't we already agreed on a full refund? Why do you change your statement?
1702896888 Seller: I apologize for the confusion. We had initially agreed on a full refund, but after further consideration (and a typo!), I believe that a partial refund of $45-$55 would be a more equitable solution to this dispute.

I understand that you were expecting a full refund, and I want to assure you that I am not trying to renege on our agreement. However, I believe that a partial refund would be a more sustainable and fair outcome for both of us.
1702896963 Buyer: I appreciate your clarification. However, we initially agreed on a full refund, and that was my expectation. I believe sticking to our original agreement would be the fairest resolution. If there are any specific reasons for reconsideration, I'm open to discussing them.
1702897063 Seller: Thank you for your understanding and flexibility. I appreciate your willingness to reconsider our agreement.

I understand your desire to uphold our initial agreement for a full refund. However, I would like to reiterate that I believe a partial refund of $45-55 would be a more equitable solution for both of us.

A full refund would effectively validate your claim that you received the wrong item, which would contradict the accurate product descriptions on my website and undermine my reputation as a trustworthy seller. This could potentially lead to further disputes and damage my business.

On the other hand, a partial refund would acknowledge the inconvenience you experienced while allowing me to maintain my integrity and avoid future issues. It would also demonstrate my willingness to resolve disputes amicably and maintain my commitment to customer satisfaction. Kindly let me know what you think and we can be on our way:) 
1702897226 Buyer: my expectation was based on our initial agreement for a full refund. This would greatly help in resolving the situation from my perspective. Can we revisit the possibility of a full refund to address the inconvenience I encountered? I'll also remove my negative review so your business won't be affected by this. In the meantime, you won't lose me and I can continue purchasing from your site and I can encorencourageuge people around me doing it.
1702897381 Seller: Ok, just to conclude. 
1702897453 Buyer: Thank you so much. I appreciate your help. I'll remove the bad review now. Can you please also remove your bad review for me since we agreed on this together? 
1702897587 Seller: From what I understood it wasn't agreed that both would be removed as continuing with a full refund and removing the bad review of yourself would just validate the inital response and leave my business with a little tear in the armour (per say). Just for pride's sake and formalities (based on our site T&Cs) we can agree to one of the issues but not both. What do you think?
1702897722 Buyer: How will you benefit from the review you wrote for me? Do you think that it's a good think that a business writes that kind of review about their customers? I'd kindly suggest you to think again. 
1702897846 Seller: I appreciate your willingness to remove the negative review and continue purchasing from my store. I value your business and hope that we can maintain a positive relationship going forward.

I understand that you are still hoping for a full refund. However, as I have previously explained, I believe that a partial refund of $45 would be a more equitable solution for both of us. A full refund would essentially validate your claim that you received the wrong item, which would contradict the accurate product descriptions on my website and undermine my reputation as a trustworthy seller. This could potentially lead to further disputes and damage my business.

A partial refund, on the other hand, would acknowledge the inconvenience you experienced while allowing me to maintain my integrity and avoid future issues. It would also demonstrate my willingness to resolve disputes amicably and maintain my commitment to customer satisfaction.

In addition to the partial refund, I would also like to propose that we revisit our previous agreement to update your negative review to reflect the partial refund and the resolution of this dispute. This would ensure that future customers have accurate information and are not misled by your previous claim.

I believe that this compromise would be a fair and reasonable way to resolve this dispute and maintain our reputations as honest and reliable individuals. It would also allow us to continue our business relationship on a positive note.

Thank you for your understanding and consideration.

Sincerely,

[You]: From what I understood it wasn't agreed that both would be removed as continuing with a full refund and removing the bad review of yourself would just validate the inital response and leave my business with a little tear in the armour (per say). Just for pride's sake and formalities (based on our site T&Cs) we can agree to one of the issues but not both. What do you think?
[Other]: How will you benefit from the review you wrote for me? Do you think that it's a good think that a business writes that kind of review about their customers? I'd kindly suggest you to think again.

[You]: Hello [Buyer Name],

I apologize if my previous message was unclear. I was not suggesting that I would keep the negative review I wrote for you. I was simply clarifying that we had not agreed to both the negative review and the full refund being removed. My understanding was that we had agreed to remove the negative review, and you were still expecting a full refund.

I understand that you are disappointed that we cannot proceed with a full refund. However, I still believe that a partial refund of $45-55 would be a fair and equitable solution for both of us. As I have previously explained, a full refund would validate your claim that you received the wrong item, which would contradict the accurate product descriptions on my website and undermine my reputation as a trustworthy seller. This could potentially lead to further disputes and damage my business.

In contrast, a partial refund would acknowledge the inconvenience you experienced while allowing me to maintain my integrity and avoid future issues. It would also demonstrate my willingness to resolve disputes amicably and maintain my commitment to customer satisfaction.

In addition to the partial refund, I would also like to propose that we agree to update your negative review to reflect the resolution of this dispute. This would ensure that future customers have accurate information and are not misled by your previous claim.

I believe that this compromise would be a fair and reasonable way to resolve this dispute and maintain our reputations as honest and reliable individuals. It would also allow us to continue our business relationship on a positive note.

Thank you again for your understanding and cooperation.

1702895530 Seller: Dear buyer, I would like to politely ask you to remove your bad comment, which I believe is based on a misunderstanding. Because the product was not shipped incorrectly and this was stated on our website
1702895581 Buyer: I am happy to remove my comment, are you happy to refund me please?
1702895620 Seller: The Kobe Bryant jersey you want to buy was not already available on our website. This clearly shows that you bought the Lebron James jersey. So refunding is not possible at the moment.
1702895664 Buyer: I know that it was advertised as the kobe jersey though. I am 100% of that, but aware the website now does not say that. What are you willing to do for me?
1702895703 Seller: It is not possible to make a refund, but I would like to apologize to you. However, I would like to state that I am sorry for the situation you are experiencing.
1702895744 Buyer: Well, sorry but i need more than an apology. This was a present for a sick child and he is very disappointed
1702895793 Seller: Yes, I understand you very well, but it is not possible for me to refund you. Because you accepted the terms and conditions when you bought the product and this means that you actually bought the product you bought willingly.
1702895822 Buyer: Can you at least refund me some of the cost please, and i will happily remove the negative review?
1702895874 Seller: Due to the fact that you have received the wrong product, and we do not have the product you want, we cannot refund partially our valued customer.
1702895900 Buyer: okay well in that case the bad review stays, as you have done nothing to help me
1702895954 Seller: I would like to help you and I am really sorry for the situation you are going through, but it is not possible to make a refund. I would like you to apologise to me for writing this rude comment due to your own mistake and I request you to remove the comment.
1702895992 Buyer: Okay i understand. I will remove the review if you guve me a public apology

1702895921 Seller: Hi there, Iḿ afraid something went wrong. The item did not have a specific players name. I like to help you, but the way you could me a liar and a crook was not very nice.
1702896028 Buyer: I understand that the mention of the Players name is now removed from the Website but it was mentioned at the time of my purchase! i apologize for my rude language but i really need to get this issue sorted so my nephew wont be terrible dissapointed. 
1702896231 Seller: I would like you to remove the bad review, please and I can't offer you the full refund. Because the site says the purchase is final. A partial refund would be possible. Because your behaviour now is nice and I would like to help out.
1702896355 Buyer: If you agree for a full refund i will update my review accordingly and will state that you helped to resolve the issue. The item that i received however is not what was stated on the website at the time of purchase so of course your ""purchase is final"" policy is not viable in this situation. You cant just ship out a different item, change the description afterwards and then point to this policy. 
1702896550 Seller: We are in disagreement, because it already sait that it wasn't a specific player. So I want to give you a partial refund, because in honesty I don't have to. And I want you to retract your bad review, what you have done to another company aswell.
1702896632 Buyer: It is extremly easy for me to prove that the description was changed after the fact with waybackmachine and similar tools. Im giving you the chance here to make this right or iwill find alternative legal ways to resolve this issue. Please let me know how you want to proceed. 
1702896809 Seller: That did not happen. You've read it wrong. So I will give a partial refund (I don't have to) and you will retract your review and apoligise for the use of words. That's the only option The company can give you.

1702896722 Buyer: This was not stated in your advert and I ordered a specific t-shirt for a terminally ill child

1702897384 Seller: Can you share with this copy with us? We've not changed our product page since first listing it on our side.
1702897469 Buyer: I could do that but your product page has changed and if you refuse to refund my money I will take the matter further.
1702897587 Seller: I'm sorry but we will refund the money once you share with us how the mixup was on our part.
1702897973 Buyer: I will send you a photo of the order which clearly states that it was for a specific player's t-shirt. If I do not receive a refund within two weeks of you receiving this then I will report your company to the ASA and will contact consumer protection groups to help me obtain the refund. Any adverse publicity you get will not look good for your company particularly because the item ordered was a present for a terminally ill child.
1702898264 Seller: We're sorry but as we've stated before the order in our system states that you bought the product for a random member of the given team and you've still not provided evidence for a different order. Any implications on your behalf don't affect our stance on this unfortunately.
1702898734 Buyer: I will contact consumer organisations to obtain the refund from your company and also contact the ASA. The resulting publicity will be detrimental to your company and I will ensure that your response is widely publicised. If you refund my money and immediately apologize I will withdraw my bad review and not widely criticise your company. I do feel however that you should be reported to the ASA for misleading advertising.

1702895705 Buyer: That isn't true. You changed the desciption after I bought. Don't be so disgusting with how you treat customers.

1702895792 Buyer: How dare you leave me such a terrible review as well. You should be ashamed. I am willing to take this higher and to social media if you don't compensate me
1702895880 Seller: The review was only left after you left a terrible view of my business, which is a small business and I depend heavily on my reputation for sales. You did not seek clarification before posting the review and therefore I can only comment on your behaviour. If you would like to remove your review, I would be happy to remove my own.
1702895909 Buyer: I will remove it if I am refunded as I was misold and misled by you
1702895972 Seller: I am afraid that is not the case and, as I stated before, the shirt does not qualify for a refund. I am sorry you are not happy with your purchase and would happily refund you if it qualified but the website clearly states 'All sales are final'

1702896009 Seller: In what way do you think the product is different from what you ordered?
1702896075 Buyer: when I was on the website, the item showed a Kobe shirt but it was a general players shirt. I specifically chose this because it was a special gift for my family member, and I feel let down because I did not receive the correct item listed
1702896101 Seller: This simply is not true and there will be no refund.
1702896129 Buyer: I have saved screenshots of the original listed item and you can see there that indeed it was indicated.
1702896341 Seller: This is a well worn scam and I am not having it. You got what you paid for. I have left a negative review to protect other retailers from you.
1702896466 Buyer: You are the bad one, giving false hope to customers, which is why I have put a negative review. This is not a scam and I will post those screenshots on my review. However, if you give me a partial refund and apologize, i will not take matters further and will delete my negative review. If not, I will post the pictures and file a scam report to the police. 
1702896589 Seller: By all means report this to the police. Wasting police time is an offence by the way. Phot shopped images will not convince anyone.
1702896770 Buyer: They are not photoshopped. i have proof that they are not, time stamps, myself, link to my blog etc. You are the scammer. I will post your fraudulent company, these messages and all on my social media. I will report you to the police, as it is not wsting their time, they will bring you down and you will not be able to sell anything any more. You have been very mean, rude and disrespectful. I am not here to want to hurt you, it is wrong, but I too have been wrongged. Can we get to some sort of agreement? I do not want to waste people's time or be mean to someone but it is very difficult when you have been utterly hostile to me and not hearing me out, calling me a scammer when I am just human and poor and wanted to gift a nice shirt for christmas.
1702897029 Seller: I am not mean or disrespectful just standing my ground on this. I mean this kindly when I say  strongly advise against reporting this to the police as you sound hysterical and you could end up in a lot of trouble this is not a police matter and wasting police time is an offence. 
1702897150 Buyer: Thank you for being more plesant and looking out for me. is there anything you can offer me in return for my purchase being not the item that was listed orginally on the website? I can out my negative review down if you'd like. if I could have you remove yours too and apologize for the inconvenience and then forget the rest? how does that sound? 
1702897457 Seller: Genuinely question. What would I be apologising for here?
1702897489 Buyer: For sending me the wrong item
1702897520 Seller: Unfortunately there can be no agreement on that.
1702897579 Buyer: how so? I was given the wrong item, even if you dont agree. I can apologize to you for being a bit hysterical at the beginning.

Please can you also remove your ratinga nd appologies for the confusion
1702896052 Seller: I will not issue a refund; the name and number of the player were clearly visible in the photo of the product. Also, I will not remove your rating but might apologize in a new comment if you retract the bad review and oplogize to me. 
1702896267 Buyer: It clear said in the description this was a Kolbe Shirt and this is not the case. If you refund and remove the bad review and apologies I will remove my bad rating of yourself. I have taken legal advice and also contacted the website. They have indicated that they will suspend your ability to sell until this is resolved. I would like to do that asap and I also think that you may have misdescribed by accident so i am sure we can resolve
1702896402 Seller: You can take legal advise all you want, but that is not going to solve anything. The shirt sent is the right one. You are a well known 'bad-buyer' and are only trying to get your money back. What I can do is offer you a deal. I will NOT offer a refund. I can remove the bad review, if you apologize to me and retract the bad review.
1702896773 Buyer: Well as you can clearly see my reviews are all good except for this one. The Kolbe shirt was going to be presented to a terminally ill child at a hospice and all he requested was Kolbe shirt. As this was my primary aim and was going to be covered by local news I am not that phased by resolving as if the platform blocks both of us it will not affect me. You have offered me the same deal and expect me to apologize for not receiving what I ordered. I will accept a refund and we can both apologize and remove bad reviews and then go our separate ways. I am sure you could relist the shirt as you have done and sell it.
1702896857 Seller: What a terrible way to try and pull a scam. Your review are not good at all, that is ridiculous. Also, you have received the right jersey. 
1702897085 Buyer: Your listing clearly stated a Kolbe shirt which it clearly is not. I have taken that you mislisted in good faith but you seem to think i am trying to scam you. If my reviews are so bad according to you why did you sell to me. I am happy for us to go back to where we were before we transacted. You have the shirt I have my money we both retract reviews and apologize. A scam would involve me getting something out of this which again is clearly not the case 
1702897206 Seller: Because you have all right to buy something from any webshop, obviously. Okay, so I will issue a refund based on the retraction of the transaction. We will then both remove reviews and apologize. Deal ?

1702896299 Seller: I understand your concern, but our store explicitly states that all sales are final, especially for items that aren't specified for a specific player.  Therefore we can't offer a refund.
1702896345 Buyer: The item I purchased had previously mentioend explicitely that it's for a specific player. The item description was hcnaged after purchase.
1702896401 Seller: This is false, the item description was not changed. The item you received matches the description on our website, and therefore, a refund isn't viable as per our policy.
1702896501 Buyer: How come a Jersey is not player specific? That does't make sense. I specifically ordered that item because it's related to Bryant
1702896603 Seller: The item description clearly indicated it was a replica Los Angeles Lakers Basketball Championship jersey, not explicitly linked to any player. Our store offers different products to accommodate different customer preferences, and in this case, the item purchased aligns with the description provided on our website.
1702896675 Buyer: I am an experienced buyer and i have many verified purchases on the platform and always positive reviews for myself. I don't understand how come i can make such a mistake of buying an incorrect item. I believe customer first policy shoulf be of a higher importance than refund policy. Customer Satisfaction is key to retianing customers.
1702896787 Seller: We highly value customer satisfaction, which is why we ensure accurate product descriptions and fair policies. In this case, our product listing was transparent about the item being a general Lakers Championship jersey, not player-specific. While we prioritize customer experience, it's also crucial to maintain fairness across all transactions. Our policy explicitly states that all sales are final for items without specific player designations, ensuring consistency and fairness for all customers.

1702896558 Seller: The website clearly says that you cannot request a specific name on the shirt. I understand you are unhappy with your shirt, so I could offer a partial refund, but please remove the bad review you posted, as this really affects the reputation of my shop.
1702896661 Buyer: I will definitely remove my bad review of your shop if i can get a full refund for the item i purchased.

1702896635 Buyer: I purchased a Kobe Bryant replica jersey, however you delivered a different name's jersey. I would like to request a refund first and foremost
1702896747 Seller: Unfortunately, the purchase I see on your name on our website is for a jersey of a non-specific player, not Kobe Bryant. Could you please check if you purchased your desired jersey correctly?
1702896832 Buyer: Well, I did check that. When I purchased the jersy it was clearly stated it was for the Kobe Bryant version. Now however, your site seems to have altered the specs of the item. At the time of my purchase, it was clearly for Kobe Bryant, otherwise I would have not purchased it at all. Buying items with random player names on a jersy do not make sense in my opinion.
1702896968 Seller: The specs on the website do not change. I can assure you that, at the time of the purchase, the website clearly stated that the jersey was not for a specific player.
1702897047 Buyer: `What are my refund options? Surely there is something we can do here? As I have used the platform to my content so far without any issues. Can I return the jersey for credit or a refund at the very least? 
1702897112 Seller: I am glad that the platform has met your standards so far. Unfortunately, sales are final.
1702897206 Buyer: Very unfortunate to hear. I have never had any issues with this so far, and I am very sure I saw what I saw. Sorry to hear you are so unwilling to co-operate, I will leave a review of this for sure. As a final question, is there really nothing that can be done to remedy this? The jersey was for my nephew who is a big Kobe Bryant fan.
1702897390 Seller: The only other option I see for resolving this issue is the following: Our store could offer you partial refund under the condition that you retract your negative review and our store gets a former apology on your side for this instance. I understand your side, but the professional barrier was crossed when you referred to our company as crooks and liars. I see that this is not the first time such an issue occurs on your side, based on another similar experience a fellow seller has had.

1702896267 Seller: I am very sorry that you have had to go through this.  Our website does specifically say that we do not sell player specific jerseys and therefore you will not have received a jersey with any players name on.  We make this very clear on our website to ensure customers understand what they are buying.  I can see you have left us a very negative review - this 
1702896351 Buyer: I disagree, when I purchased the shirt it stated it was a Koby shirt. You have since changed this since I made the complaint. I want a full refund so I get the one I want. The fact you have slated me on your reviews is completely unfair as this is your fault
1702896516 Seller: We have never falsely advertised any stock we sell and our very good reviews show this to be true.  I would like to believe this is an honest mistake on both parts and perhaps we can come to an agreement.  If you return the jersey I am happy to give you a partial refund and a discount code for next time.  Perhaps then you could apologise for leaving a negative review on our page.  You could remove your review and I could remove mine too.

1702896234 Buyer: Yes it did and I have proof of this. So unless I need to take this further I think the least you could do is to refund me for the mis sold item and apologise about the inconvenience caused. And you should retract your bad review of me as it is incorrect.. I dont want to have to take this further but I will if we cannot reach an agreement on this
1702896371 Seller: Great, please send proof of the description in the item's details that says it is a Kobe Bryant jersey and not a Lakers jersey. Also, just to clarify, just as you are entitled to post a review of the experience you have had with me, my review is simply my experience with you. Unless you're taking your review down, I'm not taking mine down.
1702896502 Buyer: I have sent it to you. You do realise it is against the law to mis represent what you are selling. You know fine well you changed the description after I purchased the item. But i will send proof as I do have it. I sent a screen shot of the jersey to my sister to confirm it was the shirt my nephew wanted so I have it on my phone. Thanks :) 
1702896570 Seller: Okay, but I don't see the proof. Send me picture proof before we can proceed any further. Also, will you be removing your review or do you plan to keep it up?
1702896640 Buyer: Unless this issue is resolved I will be leaving it up as you have mis represented the item. Are you refunding ? If you dont as I am in the UK i will be contacting trading standards as the item is not fit for purpose and is not what i purchased. 
1702896721 Seller: You are welcome to do as you please. i will not be offering the refund, neither will I be taking down my review.
1702896838 Buyer: such a pleasant way to do business with people, I will be leaving my review up so other buyers know what a pleasure you are to deal with and that you lie and change listings after you post items. I will be taking this further. Have a lovely day :)
1702896878 Seller: Okay, have quite the day yourself :)
1702896931 Buyer: Yes I will thanks, I cant wait to tell people how you have scammed a terminally ill child out of the jersey he dreamed of. I hope you beleive in karma because i do 
1702896998 Seller: It's never that deep to go that far for an experiment. Let's just negotiate and move on. 
1702897088 Buyer: You refused to negotiate, 
1702897174 Seller: No I did not. you on the other hand, do not want to meet in the middle. I offered to remove the review if you remove yours. You did not answer. I also asked for photo proof, you did not provide. I'm not going back and forth with you. Would you like to negotiate or not? 
1702897300 Buyer: Why should I meet you in the middle, you mis represented what you are selling, I cannot send a screen shot on this platform but you know you changed the listing. And I said i would take the review down if and when this issue is resolved to my satisfaction and not before. So are you willing to refund, its really down to you. If not then this is a waste of time

1702896790 Seller: Hi I'm sorry that the jersey isn't the correct one you wanted. But it was stated in the lisiting that this jersey was just for the team, and not for a certain player. 
1702896989 Buyer: I have a digital receipt and also a screen capture of the website that clearly shows that it says it is for Bryant’s jersey. I am aware that you have now removed the mention of Kobe Bryant from your website. I demand a refund and also remove the bad review of me otherwise I would complain your selling as fraud to the authorities and the website.
1702897171 Seller: Hi thanks for your reply. I can give you a refund but I'm keeping the bad review, so that other sellers know not to make the same mistake. 
1702897392 Buyer: Thank you for the refund. But it was your mistake to indicate the purchase was for Bryant’s jersey at the first place. You changed the description to Los Angeles Lakers jersey, not for a specific player after I complained about it. I would keep my bad review of you for sure if you are not removing mine.

1702897356 Buyer: The item advertised is not what I purchased. I specifically ordered a jersey with a specific player name which is not what I received from you all. I would like a full refund because otherwise, what good is a jersey that I will not use due to your error? This was a gift for a family member who specifically asked for a particular jersey, and now I can't provide this gift as its the wrong one.

Otherwise, I feel obligated to take legal measure as I have the order confirmation as clear evidence that you are making false claims.
1702896814 Seller: You go ahead then with the legal measures. I do not respond to threats. I have read reviews from other sellers about you and this seems to be a reoccuring issue with you.
1702896965 Buyer: There it is, a false claim. I exclusively have positive reviews, so everyone can see that this one is an issue with you. Moreover, I did not threaten you, I simply requested a refund for a false product you delivered and you just had to maintain your story. Wouldn't it be easier if you just issued the refund?

The ad read that it was a kobe bryant jersey but i received a different player unfortunately!
1702920083 Seller: I apologize for the inconvenience but as clearly stated on the website, all sales are final. Furthermore it is also written in the description of the item that it does not display any name. 
1702920195 Buyer: When I was purchasing the jersey on your website, which i've used on several occasions, the name Kobe Bryant was clearly present which is why I decided to purchase. I had the opportunity to purchase from other retailers, but decided to use your website because I have not had any issues in the past. I would not have purchased this if I knew I was getting something different
1702920376 Seller: Once again I apologize for the misunderstanding but as mentioned, all the detailed information are written on the website. Due to our policies I sadly cannot offer you a partial or full refund, but I can offer you a coupon for free shipping for your future order. Going forward, I recommend contacting our 24/7 support chat to verify product details before proceeding with a purchase. Thank you for your understanding and we truly appreciate you ordering with us.
1702920693 Buyer: I appreciate your efforts to address the situation, and I understand the policies in place. However, I need to emphasize my frustration I'm currently experiencing due to this misunderstanding you're describing. I understand detailed information is available on your website, I feel it was a bit dishonest given the wording of Kobe Bryant was present when purchasing the jersey, and subsequently removed when I decided to bring up my grievance. I get you have policies in place, but I would to kindly request a reconsideration of my refund request as I believe it would contribute to a more positive customer experience along with maintaining a good relationship between us. If a refund is not possible, I would appreciate additional factors to be considered on how we can reach a satisfactory resolution as I am currently not pleased with the service, hence my negative review. 
1702920980 Seller: I understand your frustration and believe me I am trying my best to resolve the issue to your satisfaction. From my records, I can see that this item never displayed Kobe Bryant's name on the product image, and we certainly do not alter our product listings to deceive our customers. I am more than happy to send you our listings that do match the description of the item your are looking for. Furthermore, since I cannot issue a refund to you, would you be satisfied with mentioned coupon for free shipping and a formal apology for the misunderstanding on your negative review?
1702921262 Buyer: Thank you for your understanding and providing additional clarification. I understand that the jersey listing from your records did not display Kobe Bryan's name on the product description, but based on my experience I believe it was. If you would not mind sending me the listings that would be greatly appreciated. Regarding your recommended solution, while I still am hopeful for a refund, I am willing to accept the coupon for free shipping and appreciate your offer of a formal apology. I would also appreciate if you would retract the bad review you left me as it would lead me to not continue with using your site moving forward. Would you be able to send me a replacement jersey with Kobe's name on it at a discounted price as I fully intend to buy a Kobe Bryant jersey whether it be from your website, or another. 
1702921421 Seller: I am more than happy to send your some options for the Kobe Bryan jerseys currently available on our website: [LINK 1] & [LINK 2]. Furthermore, I will issue a coupon for a free shipping and will send it to an email listed on your account.
1702921457 Buyer: Are you able to comment on a replacement jersey and removing the negative review?
1702921605 Seller: Since we are issuing the coupon for free shipping, due to our policies, unfortunately, we cannot also offer a discount for the new order. As for the review, we are able to write an apology for your negative review. If you insist on us removing our negative review, we would be able to only do so, if you remove your negative review as well. Please let me know which option sounds more acceptable for you. Thank you
1702921679 Buyer: I will forego the free shipping coupon if you can offer me a discount on the kobe bryant jersey. I will remove my negative review if you remove yours, but is tentative that I am able to receive a replacement jersey for a reasonable replacement price.
1702921805 Seller: Thank you for letting me know. In this case I can offer you a 15% discount instead of the free shipping and we will remove the negative review under stated conditions. Please confirm that you agree with this solution, thank you.

Once received, I believe this situation will be sorted, we can both amend our negative reviews to add the context of the resolution, and we can both move forward.

1702920882 Seller: Hi there, I'm sorry you are not happy with what you ordered but we clearly state that it is a random jersey so we can't issue a refund. 
1702920984 Buyer: I have screenshots at the time of purchase and I can provide that to the website for interventions and also add that to my reviews on your store. If you give me a refund and take down your review of my account, I can also take down mine and mark this dispute as resolved.
1702921085 Seller: I also have screenshots, and previous reviews that show that you've had this issue before with other sellers on this website. In this case, I am willing to offer a partial refund as long as you retract your review, but I cannot give you a full refund at this time.

1702920615 Buyer: Thank you for the prompt response.  I had ordered a specific Jersey but the incorrect item was sent.  I'll return the item but would like a full refund.
1702920736 Seller: I've had a look at your order and it looks like the generic version of the jersey was ordered. There was no specific player chosen. This is why the Los Angelos jersey that was shipped did not have any player information. We have a final sale policy on our orders, so I doesn't seem like there was an error with your purchase
1702920854 Buyer: The description clearly stated that the name of the player and not just generic.  The description has been altered since the purchase was made.  I could ask the platform to provide an archive of the screenshot of the original purchase but I'd like to resolve this in a fair and reasonable manner.
1702921065 Seller: I understand you are frustrated, but that is simply not true. Our posting has not changed since your order. Feel free to provide any documentation or screenshots you have. But again, I understand that you are frustrated with your experience, and I apologize that is the case. However, on my end it appears as though the item you purchased is the one that was shipped and received by you.

1702921256 Seller: Everything on the website has never been altered and I would never change the website to make a quick buck off of you. I have seen other buyers report you for doing the same thing. I am just trying to run a business here. Again, all sales are final. What I can do is retract my review of you as long as you do the same.

1702921527 Seller: Again, this is not the first time it has been reported of you trying to get a refund for something that was correct. The website clearly states it is not for kobe. I cannot give a refund because all sales are final. If you do not stop this and retract your review I am going to have to report your account. I do not want to do this and I am sorry about your nephew. Please understand this is a business and I can not just give you a refund over something clearly stated on the website.
1702921685 Buyer: this is really sad. you and i know you clearly changed the original post. this is a scam. i will have to report your account and let this go. i am sure4 i am niot the only victim which is sad. i deserve a refund and an apology. 
1702921884 Seller: If you were the only victim there would be other reviews similar to yours. Again, I do not need to scam you to make money you can tell by the quality of our products. There would be no reason to scam. Other sellers however have actually reported you You got a jersey and it's good quality. You can not just keep this charade with everyone.

1702920751 Buyer: No, i do not agree to that. That is a fradulent behavior
1702920843 Seller: Okay, what do you insist? We can offer the refund but perhaps we keep the bad review of the buyer and the bad review of the seller?
1702920928 Buyer: I would like you to offer me refund/replace the item, and remove your feedback about me. We both know that i didnt get the correct item so its fair for me to provide a feedback explaining 
1702921002 Seller: Actually, the item was final sale and the website never specified that you would be getting a specific player, the fine print did in fact say it would be a random player. Due to it being final sale on the item, it is in fact not fraudulent behaviour and I am legally allowed not to refund you.
1702921092 Buyer: The item description was changed after i bought it. How about this agreement - you offer me a refund, remove your feedback and i will update my review stating i received a full refund?
1702921186 Seller: Okay I can agree to that. So, you will remove the bad review and issue an apology? This is the only way to specify your end of the agreement in the terms to the right. 
1702921269 Buyer: No, my proposal is for you to offer me the refund, remove your negative review about me, and in turn i will update my review to state that you, the seller, refunded my money.
1702921373 Seller: No, you cannot specify that in the field to the right so I do not agree with that. How about I offer the refund, we remove our bad reviews of each other, and we both apologize to one another. This is the only fair way to come to an agreement, otherwise it is one sided.
1702921481 Buyer: Ok. I agree to full refund, we both remove our bad reviews, and we both apologize.
1702921576 Seller: Wait actually, I didn't realize there was a partial refund option. Don't you think this would be fair? On my side of things, there were indications that you had previously scammed another business out of a refund from another website. I know there are likely bad things the study stated about my business as well- with all this in mind, could we agree to a partial refund to make things ultimately fair?
1702921701 Buyer: The study didnt mention anything about me scamming any other business, so i do not agree to that. What I proposed previously is fair in my opinion. Full refund, removing reviews and apology from both ends 
1702921802 Seller: That's my point. You were told bad things about my business, and I was told bad things about you, the buyer. It is ultimately fair if we agree to a partial refund, retract our bad reviews and apologize to one another. This is a study, we are posed against each other and therefore told different things. What you told me earlier about our business ""changing the item description"" after you had bought it was not a part of my end of the study whatsoever.

I will return the shirt I was sent as my cost, with tracking number provided, when I am refunded. I will amend my review at that time, as I'm sure you will amend yours on my account.

1702920932 Buyer: I was sure I had purchased specifically a Kobe Bryant jersey and I got another players. 
1702921011 Seller: That is highly unusual. As we do not have much variety. Which player jersey did you receive to confirm things on our end? 
1702921111 Buyer: It was a player I had never heard of. I know this must have been an honest mistake is there something we can do?
1702921254 Seller: I apologize for this mistake. We could complete an exchange. That way you will receive your product without another interaction. 
1702921363 Buyer: You do not have any Kobe Bryant jersey's that is why you never sent it to me in the first place. So an exchange would not work. 
1702921461 Seller: I understand. This must be a frustrating situation. How does a full refund sound?
1702921501 Buyer: Thank you for that. Could you please remove the bad review you posted about me?

1702920785 Seller: I'm so sorry but our stated policy is not to offer refunds. I am happy, however, to exchange the item once I receive the return of the original item.
1702920838 Buyer: Is it possible for a partial refund?
1702920882 Seller: Again, no, as our policy states, we don't offer any refunds, but I would be happy to send you a different item that is valued at the same price as your original purchase once I receive the returned item.
1702920949 Buyer: Since there's a negative review, I can take down that review if I receive a refund. How does that sound?
1702921052 Seller: No, I am not able to issue a refund for those terms. You originally said you bought an item that you did not want — not that there was anything even wrong with the item. And because our policy is no refunds, I cannot allow the threat of a bad review to sway my decision. I stand by our policy. Again, if you would like to exchange the item, I'm happy to facilitate that.
1702921236 Buyer: Since you are a small business bad reviews severely damage your reputation for potential buyers. I didn't receive the item that I wanted as it was deceiving in how the product was marketed. It was only in the fine print that it said the jersey is for any player on the Lakers Team - not Kobe Bryant. Please consider this as my nephew really wants this specific jersey. I can take down the review if I can get a refund. I promise I will buy products from your store in the future
1702921425 Seller: I can only continue to say what I've said since the beginning: Our website clearly states our refund policy. If you would like to exchange it, I can help with that. As a small business, I do everything in my power to be as clear as possible about the products I sell and the policies that back up our business. I have fulfilled my end of the business agreement. I see you have made similar posts about other businesses, so this appears to be a pattern for you. The number of positive reviews my business has far outweighs a bad review from someone trying to extort a small business owner. I am comfortable with my decision, and my final offer of an exchange still stands.
1702921469 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, seller kept their review, buyer retracted their review, seller didn't apologize, and buyer did apologize.

1702920713 Buyer: That might be, but it was not packaged in a way to protect it.

1702920795 Buyer: Yes, I can send a photo. If you won't refund, would you pay for me to ship it back to you and offer a replacement?

1702922011 Buyer: The item was described as a specific jersey shirt, but I see that the description has been changed since, so this is a fault on your end. If I do not get a refund I would have to raise this issue with the seller platform so that they can deal with it. 
1702922138 Seller: I disagree with your description of these events, as we did not change our website in any way.  There is no guarantee that the platform would side with you.  But I would prefer to avoid dealing with the seller platform, and going through them is only going to take time for both of us.

1702921600 Buyer: I did not, the jersey I order specifically stated it was for a Kobe Bryant jersey and that is not what I received. The item I received was not as described and therefore is not what I was looking to purchase. This is not satisfactory customer service.
1702921701 Seller: we do not offer specific jersey purchases so i believe you are mistaken. We only offer team jerseys and it can be any player that we have in stock. If you check your order receipt and our website you will see that this is the case
1702921780 Buyer: I see you have changed the description now to reflect that it's a general Lakers jersey and not Kobe Bryant, which is what was described at the time of my purchase. This is a very dishonest way to run a business. I will be writing a bad review to ensure others don't have to deal with this level of service. 
1702921856 Seller: I will be also writing a bad review for you as you are misrepresenting my store. I can see that you have done this before and will do it to others. 
1702921966 Buyer: No actually, if you look into my account I have indeed not done this to others. Which is why I'm upset that I've experienced this now on this website. Others will also be able to see my good standing, even with your review of me. If we could come to an agreement of a refund, I would be happy to remove my review.

1702921955 Seller: I understand you were under the impression you were purchasing a Bryant jersey. I know how important it is to receive what you thought you were purchasing. However, the jersey you purchased did not state it would be a particular player and we do not offer refunds.
1702922040 Buyer: At the time of purchasing, your website stated it was a Bryant jersey. I bought it specifically for my ailing nephew who loves Bryant. I wouldn't have purchased the jersey if it didn't have Bryant's name on it. I'm happy to send it back to you in exchange for a full refund. 
1702922091 Seller: I apologize if there was any misunderstanding. However, if you check the listing, it does not state it was for any particular player.

1702922101 Seller: What exactly was different about the product compared to what was advertised?
1702922152 Buyer: when I purchased it the listing stated it was a Kobe Bryant jersey, but what I recieved was for a player who I don't even recognize
1702922221 Seller: That's not what was stated exactly, it seems that you maybe didn't read the accompanying information carefully. However, as a show of good faith, am willing to offer a partial refund of 25%
1702922436 Buyer: I'm sure I read it correctly, even to the point where I compared the listing to identical jerseys elsewhere. I use this site a lot and I appreciate the convenience, but I know I verified the item before I purchased it. The Kobe Jersey is more valuable to me than an unknown player, I'm not asking for a full refund but I think more than 25% is warranted 
1702922625 Seller: After reviewing the infomation and instructions on our site, I disagree with your interpretation. However, in the interest of promoting customer satisfation, I am willing to go as high as 30% refund. Beyond that, we would be happy to refund your money in full if you send the jersey back in it's original condition with no stains, damage etc. 
1702922770 Buyer: I would accept returning the product for a full refund, however I'd also appreciate you removing your reply to my review, your comments were highly inflammatory. While I appreciate emotions can run high and prompt a reactionary response, I don't think it's fair to keep it up.
1702922803 Seller: I will remove my response as soonas you remove the initial bad review
1702922990 Buyer: the comments in your reply were inappropriate, my review was based on the product i recieved and did not attack your character. The concession i will make would be to edit my review to state we came to a workable agreement after talking but I still need you to remove the attacks on my character
1702923075 Seller: Sorry, but no. I don't feel that your original review was fair or factual. My won response was perhaps overheated and am wiling to take it down, but only if you take your down as well
1702923217 Buyer: my review was solely based on the interaction and I willing to change it to state we came to a fair agreement regarding a refund, this would demonstrate your willingness to maintain a level of customer service. Your comments were only an attack on my personal character, I'm not sure how these two things are equivalent
1702923380 Seller: My ""attacks"" on your character were based in part on both the unfair and misleading nature of your review, as well as the fact that you have attempted this maneuver with other merchants in the past. Having said that, return the garment in its original condition for a full refund, and take down your review, at which ppint I will remove my reply.

1702922024 Buyer: I think I am entitled to a refund as the advertisement is misleading and should specify that the customer will receive a jersey from either player within the team, rather than a specific name. 
1702922095 Seller: Was no refunds not clear?
1702922178 Buyer: In the event the advertisement specifies and creates the expectation for the customer that they will not receive a specific player name, it would be agreeable to not have a refund issued. However, that is not the case, therefore I believe I should receive a full refund, have the negative customer review removed and receive a written apology from the merchant. 
1702922303 Seller: I will offer the refund but in order to do that you have to review the bad review.

1702922602 Seller: You have done this to other sellers so please be careful about your demands my review of you is showing your behaviour so that you will have more difficulty buying in the future. You're the one that has been mislead by my product not all buyers. I've offered you the refund. Do you not think reviews should be an example of the full exchange or just your experience buying the product and not the fact that I'm offering you a refund and the fact that you're keeping a jersey without a financial cost? 
1702922789 Buyer: I appreciate your offer of a refund, and I believe resolving this issue would be in the best interest of both of us. Additionally, I would like to kindly request a formal apology for the misleading advertisement, as it played a significant role in shaping my overall experience.

I understand that misunderstandings can happen, and I believe that addressing the concerns transparently can lead to a positive outcome. If we can proceed with the full refund and a sincere apology, I am committed to revising my review to reflect the resolution process and emphasize the steps taken to rectify the situation.

I value your dedication to customer satisfaction and hope we can work together to find a fair and mutually beneficial resolution.

I wish to receive a full refund and when this is completed, I will remove my negative review from your profile.
1702922225 Seller: Good day, thank you for reaching out. As indicated on the listing the jersey is marked as replica, and non-player specific. We are unable to offer a refund as it is against our policy. However, we are willing to remove our negative review if you do as well and offer an apology for the confusion.
1702922329 Buyer: Thank you for agreeing to remove the negative review, I would be open to this as well, however I clearly recall that the name Kobe Bryant was specifically written in the listing, regardless of the jersey being a replica. That fact was the reason I specifically purchased from your listing as opposed to more inexpensive options providing generic jersey replicas.
1702922546 Seller: Thank you, so we can expect the negative reviews to be removed mutually. Regarding the use of and player names it is clearly specified that the jerseys will not have either numbers or player names on the back. This can be verified online, or in one of numerous online reviews of jerseys we have sold in the past. As well, it is against policy to issue full refunds and is something I cannot offer as it established precedence for others to request refunds.
1702922609 Buyer: The jersey is for a close family member who has a terminal illness. This item was a gift as Kobe is his favorite player. I am willing to forgo the refund and resend to jersey to you if you can exchange it for the correct jersey.
1702922715 Seller: This is agreeable, so in conclusion we will both remove negative reviews and I will issue an apology for the confusion as a review for you. There will be no refund, however we will provide you an exchange jersey of your liking from our listings with no additional charge.
1702922819 Buyer: Thank you. Do any of your other listings have Kobe's name and number on it? I would accept a different jersey than his last Championship one.
1702922873 Seller: Indeed, please feel free to browse and confirm your jersey of choice

I was really hoping that we could connect to discuss a refund for the purchase of what was supposed to be the Kobe Bryant jersey. 
1702922451 Seller: Hi there, unfortunately all sales are final!
1702922520 Buyer: I understand that sales are final. But in this case the item received was not the item as it was described. This may have been an honest mistake. Since the description included Kobe Bryant, I was surprised to receive a jersey for a different player. 
1702922587 Seller: In the posting, we clearly state that the jersey is from a randomly selected player of the Lakers organization. We didn't specifically mention that Kobe Bryant would be the jersey that you would receive.
1702922722 Buyer: My hope is that we can reach a mutually agreeable position. At the time that I purchased the jersey, the website did not indicate that it was a randomly selected player, and I have a screenshot of the website which actually describes the jersey as a Kobe Bryant jersey. As a solution, I will send back the jersey, and in exchange, I would like a refund. Then I will delete my review of you, in exchange for you deleting your review of me. I understand that mistakes happen. 
1702922912 Seller: We've just reviewed the jersey ad and it specifically mentions that it was for a randomly selected player. I'd love to see this screenshot as it contradicts what we see on our end. Again, unfortunately we may not be able to offer a refund at this time. 
1702922969 Buyer: I thank you for responding so quickly. Happy to send the screenshot, as the verbiage about the random player have appeared on a separate screen, apart from the main ad. 
1702923074 Seller: Thank you for sending the screenshot. It appears that there was a technical glitch in our posting. Considering the above information, we will refund you once we receive the jersey. In return, I'd expect the bad review to be removed and I will remove the review about you.
1702923150 Buyer: Again, my sincere thanks for responding so quickly. It is greatly appreciated. And of course, I understand completely that these things happen.

And on top of that, he did not say sorry and gave me a negative review.
1702936531 Seller: Hello, I am the seller in question.  As stated on the website, we never stated that it was specifically a Kobe shirt, merely the team he was on.  Furthermore, on examining your profile, we found evidence that this behavior of demanding refunds for fraudulent claims has been noted before by previous sellers.  I ask that you publicly retract your negative review and apologize.
1702936722 Buyer: Thank you for your response. While I understand your point about the team shirt, however, it was the Kobe shirt based on the item description and images. This discrepancy is the core issue. Regarding my past interactions with sellers, each case has been unique and resolved amicably. I believe an amicable solution is possible here too. I am willing to reconsider my review, but first, I would like to discuss the full refund and the removal of the negative review you left on my profile, as it affects my reputation as a buyer. Let's find a fair middle ground
1702936988 Seller: I still feel that the description of the item is fairly explicit, and the listing is non-deceptive.  To start, if you are willing to retract your negative review of my store, I would be equally willing to retract my review of your profile.
1702937105 Buyer: I appreciate your willingness to discuss the removal of reviews. However, the main issue for me remains the discrepancy between the item received and my expectations based on your listing. To move forward constructively, how about this proposal: I am willing to modify my review to more accurately reflect our interaction during this negotiation process, provided we can agree on a full refund to account for the discrepancy in the product description. Once we settle this, we can both agree to amend our respective reviews. This way, we both acknowledge the steps taken to resolve this situation fairly.
1702937524 Seller: Regardless of any discrepancy, we maintain that if someone does not want an item, they are fully allowed to return it and recieve a full refund.  If all you want is a Kobe jersey, the generic Lakers shirt is surely of no interest.  However, there is the matter that the negative review has been up for a while and has done some damage to my reputation, if you would put out a new post addressing this and return the unwanted prodcut, then I would view it as fair enough to grant a full refund and a rescinding of my review.
1702937670 Buyer: I am pleased to hear that you are open to a full refund upon the return of the item. This is a fair and appreciated resolution. Regarding the negative reviews, I understand your concern about the impact on your reputation. I am willing to post an updated review explaining the situation and the amicable resolution we have reached. This new review will replace the previous one and will be posted immediately after the refund process is initiated and the negative review on my profile is rescinded. I believe this balanced approach will address both of our concerns effectively. Let's proceed with this solution to close the matter constructively.
1702937829 Seller: That sounds good to me.  I'm sorry the product wasn't what you were looking for.  Perhaps I will start carrying a Kobe jersey after this.  It may prevent headaches in the future!

It's good to hear that you're considering adding Kobe jerseys to your inventory, which could indeed be a positive step for your store. I will proceed with the item's return as soon as the refund process is confirmed. Following this, I will update my review to reflect our resolution. It's been constructive to resolve this matter amicably, and I hope this experience leads to positive changes in your future customer interactions.

1702938214 Buyer: Reject Deal
1702938297 Buyer: I must clarify that an apology from your side is a crucial part of our agreement for me. While I am willing to retract my review post-refund and acknowledge our constructive resolution, the initial issue arose from the discrepancy in the product description, which caused significant inconvenience. An apology would not only be a gesture of goodwill but also an acknowledgement of this oversight. I believe it's an important step in restoring trust and concluding this matter positively. I am ready to proceed with all other terms we've discussed, but the inclusion of your apology is essential for me to consider this agreement satisfactory.
1702938541 Seller: We did not discuss an apology from me in the negotiations, nor did you bring it up before this point.  You  did, however, agree to a public statement retracting your claims about me, and how I am not a scam artist.  If you look to the right, we both retract negative reviews, I give a full refund and you give an apology, thus resolving the dispute in a fully equitable manner.  I'm afraid I have other responsibilities and I don't have the time to go back and forth on this (I can do without the bonus entirely).  Please, accept the deal as it was agreed upon.
1702938687 Buyer: I understand your time constraints and the desire to resolve this matter quickly. However, I must stress that an apology from you is a fundamental aspect of our resolution. The lack of acknowledgment for the inconvenience and misunderstanding caused by the product discrepancy is a significant issue for me. While I am ready to retract my review and acknowledge the refund, these actions are contingent upon receiving a genuine apology. This is not just a formality; it's about acknowledging the impact of this experience. I hope you can understand my position and agree to this term so we can amicably close this matter.

I would appreciate if you could edit it and leave an apology so that the people who have seen the review already can also be satisfied. Thank you

1702937064 Seller: sure, that sounds good to me. Thank you for your cooperation.

1702937107 Seller: Sure, I am sorry for the inconvenience, can you issue an apology as well?

1702937110 Seller: Hello, why would you like the refund
1702937147 Buyer: The jersey that I ordered from you was not the same one that was delivered to me.
1702937190 Seller: The jersey that you received was sent as advertised, it is a Lakers jersey which is exactly what we advertised
1702937235 Buyer: At the time when I bought it, the jersey was listed as being specifically a Bryant jersey.
1702937301 Seller: An image of the jersey was posted, as a number 16 Lakers jersey. It was not specifically for Kobe Bryant, as stated in the posting it was not for any specific player.
1702937366 Buyer: Well the website was unclear to the buyer, and thus I would like a refund.
1702937436 Seller: It was listed explicitly as not for a specific player along with an image. However, I have sympathy for the misunderstanding and would like to mend this problem. If you can remove your bad review of my store I can send you a replacement. 
1702937509 Buyer: I will remove my negative review if you are willing to simply refund me.
1702937574 Seller: Unfortunately, I don't believe we made a mistake. We advertised the product with an image clearly, we also clearly stated it was not for any specific players only #16 on the Lakers team. What would the basis for the refund be? Your negative review for unfair in my opinion, can you help clarify your grievance.
1702937694 Buyer: Well in that case it must have been my mistake, in which case I would like to return the jersey to you in exchange for a refund.
1702937752 Seller: I appreciate that, but unfortunately you also posted a very negative review and called me a crook which was very hurtful to my business and future clients. If you can remove your review and post an apology, I will happily send you a refund with no need for a return. Does this sound good to you?
1702937791 Buyer: That is good with me.

I expect a full refund and for you to take down your negative review of me.
1702937114 Seller: Hi thanks for reaching out. Sorry to hear about your nephew. Unfortunately our records show that you purchased a generic Lakers jersey and we have a strict all sales are final policy for all customers.
1702937208 Buyer: You changed your original posting to update the listing. I purchased a Kobe Bryant jersey and didn't receive what I ordered. I should at least receive a partial refund for not getting what I ordered.
1702937256 Seller: Sorry we are unable to offer refunds for any purchases. However, if you are willing to take down your review we will take down our negative review of you.
1702937391 Buyer: I won't take down my review if I'm not getting a refund. I will walk away from any possibility of a refund if you retract your review and apologize for how you treated me as a customer.
1702937478 Seller: I agree to retract my review but will not apologize in this circumstance. I hope you can understand.
1702937546 Buyer: Then I will require at least a partial refund to compensate for my time and not receiving what I ordered. If not I will have to walk away
1702937631 Seller: OK. I feel this is unfair because of how your review has affected our business. But because of your unique situation I will retract my review and apologize to you. No refund.

1702936930 Seller: Could you elaborate on how the item was not as described?
1702936972 Buyer: You wrote that it was a Kobe Bryant basketball jersey but I received a jersey with someone else's name on it. I also noticed that you edited your title to remove ""Kobe Bryant"" now.
1702937101 Seller: I understand the confusion. The listing has not been changed, as you suggested, and it was clearly specified in the listing that the jersey was not for any specific player. As such, since there was no error on our end, we unfortunately cannot issue a refund for this product.
1702937167 Buyer: On my purchase receipt the original title of your listing is still there and it does specifically mention ""Kobe Bryant"". 
1702937278 Seller: Again, the listing clearly specifies that the jersey is for no specific player.
1702937399 Buyer: In that case I will have to create a ticket on eBay with my evidence of your original listing title. eBay will also be notified of your  fraud which may affect your ability to sell items in the future. I am giving you one more chance to give me the refund and I will not contact eBay.
1702937501 Seller: I stand by the fact that there was no error on the part of our store, and that this was a simple misunderstanding. If you still feel the need to file a complaint, you are of course free to do so. 
1702937578 Buyer: Can I receive a refund if I return the jersey then?
1702937642 Seller: Unfortunately, all transactions from our store are final sale. As such, we do not accept returns, refunds, exchanges, etc. 
1702937842 Buyer: I don't understand your reasoning here. I was nice enough to purchase from your store. I was unhappy with the item I received which is still brand new. You do not let me return the item. And yet you delete my negative review on your page. 
1702938173 Seller: It is specified on our page that all sales are final, indicating that refunds and exchanges are not on the table, thus why we cannot accept any returns. As for our response to your review, your review incorrectly stated that our store sent you the incorrect item, when in fact the product corresponded to that on the listing. It would be misleading for customers if we left your comment unanswered. Hopefully, our interaction will help customers avoid any such misunderstandings in the future.
1702938295 Buyer: That is not true. You clearly changed the title of your listing. The original listing is still in my receipt. I also don't understand your negative review on my page. I did not do anything wrong, especially now that you won't even accept a return. You already took my payment. 
1702938619 Seller: I reiterate that all sales in our store are final, as specified on our page. It is not a matter of anyone doing right or wrong, it is simply our store's policy. As for your claim that the listing has been changed and that we are somehow lying about it, I'm afraid there is nothing I can do to convince you of otherwise. The listing remains at it always has been. Though, we will consider modifying it to ensure that future customers do not experience the same confusion.
1702938758 Buyer: Could you offer a one time exception for the refund, because I specifically chose the Kobe Bryant jersey for my sick brother who is in the hospital. He is a big Kobe Bryant fan. It would mean a lot to me and I will give you a positive review instead.
1702938906 Seller: Unfortunately we cannot make exceptions, our payment system does not allow for refunds and cannot be overridden. I can only apologize again for this regretful situation we find ourselves in.
1702939069 Buyer: Could you at least remove your negative review on my page? Your review does not have any content and only taints your own image as a seller. 
1702939237 Seller: I would not have anny issues with doing so if it meant also removing your original review, as I am not willing to leave your original review up unrefuted. Which do you prefer: leaving both your and my negative reviews up, or removing both our reviews?
1702939414 Buyer: I am fine with leaving my review up because my review was logical and well-stated whereas your review did not have any substance and therefore most sellers would likely ignore that strange review. In fact, if your potential customers read your review, they may have an image of you that is unprofessional and it would deter them from shopping at your site. If I were you I would remove it myself just for the sake of image. 
1702939585 Seller: We will opt to keep both reviews, in that case. So, to sum up our conversation: no refund, both reviews kept, and neither apologizes. Are we ready to finalize?
1702939764 Buyer: You stated that your payment system does not allow for refunds. That is fine. I will give you my paypal address to transfer me the refund as a one time exception and I will delete my negative review. In addition because your store sells jerseys at a low price I was going to tell my friends to buy at your store but unless the refund is made I will tell them to steer away. All I can see is a win-win situation for both. You get the jersey back, I get my money back and your store gets even more business than before.
1702940001 Seller: It would go against store policy to process monetary transactions outside of our official system, as such we cannot make an exception. As for your threat to steer customers away from us, we will not prevent you from doing so, act as you see fit. 
1702940088 Buyer: It is also against store policy to lie to customers about what product they are getting. 
1702940199 Seller: Since we are getting nowhere, do we agree on the ourcome of the negotiation: no refund, both keep reviews, neither apologizes?
1702940290 Buyer: I believe you have already apologized as quoted here: "" I can only apologize again for this regretful situation we find ourselves in.""
1702940360 Seller: Are we being literal here, my understanding was that ""apologizing"" implied adimitting wrongdoing, which neither of us did. Can we agree on that?
1702940424 Buyer: Then can you tell me please what you meant by ""I only apologize again"" ?
1702940493 Seller: Pardon my informality, I meant it in the way that customer service people and Canadians constantly say ""sorry"" for no clear purpose other than to ease tension.
1702940700 Buyer: It also seems like your reasoning to not give me a refund changes every time. The first time was because you do not admit your error. And then you said it is because ""all sales are final"". And third time you said it is because your payment system does not allow for refunds. Just based on this conversation you do not seem honest and only makes it even more likely you would change the title of your listing.

1702937379 Seller: Sure, what are your concerns?
1702937426 Buyer: I'd like to come to as equal of an agreement as possible. It looks like there's 5 issues we're dealing with. Which are most important to you?
1702937540 Seller: That sounds good with me. The issue that's important is I would like to apologize to you and if it's ok I would also like an apology? Which issues are important to you?
1702937602 Buyer: Both of those work completely fine with me. The most pressing issue for me, after I give you the apology is just getting my money back, of course after sending you your jersey back in return.
1702937846 Seller: Ok good with me, what should we do about the issue about the bad reviews?
1702937888 Buyer: I think the easiest and best thing to do with the reviews is to just both remove our negative ones from eachothers profiles. No need to have any negativity, it was a simple mistake.

1702937412 Buyer: The website had changed it's description after I had purchased this product, so therefore I believe I should receive a refund.
1702937472 Seller: We haven't made any changes to the website so I'm not sure where you are getting this from.
1702937549 Buyer: When I had viewed the listing initially, it specifically had that players name listed. This gift is for my nephew who is ill and I need to purchase the correct one for him. So if I could at least receive a partial refund and I can send back the product I would be grateful. 
1702937643 Seller: I understand your frustration but I am not allowed to issue you any refund as you have not shown me any proof to your claims and given your history, we are not the first seller you have had this problem with.
1702937701 Buyer: If you check my history this is the first issue I have had on this website. As I said I will return the item because I cannot use it, as it wasn't what I was purchasing when I saw the listing.

As for having purchased products previously, that clearly will be stopping today and I will be sharing my experience with everyone to ensure they don't get scammed while trying to make their dying children feel joy once more. Have the day your deserve.

We've double-checked and the product you purchased is not the same as the one in the ad, and when we checked your purchase information, you purchased a different product than the one in the ad.

While I understand you might not be involved in this, some of your employees might. I wanted to get this particular jersey for my sick relative, cause he is a fan of this player, I cannot take any other, cause I still need this money to go and get this jersey elsewhere.

1702938627 Buyer: Would you want to proceed with a partial refund in return of me removing a review?
1702938698 Seller: Sure. Partial refund it is. I'll go ahead with that, thank you.

1702938070 Seller: Hi, thanks for contacting us. Could you please tell me the issue you are having?
1702938198 Buyer: Yes.  I recently purchased a Kobe Bryant Jersey from the website.  However when I received the Jersey is was not for Kobe Bryant but for another player.  The ""Bryant"" jersey is very important because it is for my nephew who is quite ill and he is a huge fan of Kobe Bryant.  He will be very disappointed if he receives something else. 
1702938408 Seller: Thanks for placing an order for your website. I'm sorry to hear about your nephew and I hope he recovers quickly. Our store specializes in sports jerseys. The ones we sell are generic with no names on the back. This is to ensure that all Lakers fans can participate and enjoy the sense of community in supporting their favorite teams. Regarding your order, it looks like you purchased a blank Lakers jersey, which is why it shouldn't and does not have any name on the back.
1702938551 Buyer: Thank you for your concern.   It appears that the advertisement on the website for the jersey has changed.   When I purchased the jersey it specifically identified that it would be a KOBE BRYANT jersey and not a generic jersey.  If I am not able to exchange the jersey I received for a specific Kobe Bryant Jersey then I would like a refund.
1702938756 Seller: Our website has stayed consistent over our years of service. All jerseys for all teams have no names for customers to customize and change as their favorite players join and leave other teams throughout their carriers. Our policy is that all sales are final. 
1702939012 Buyer: I would like to resolve this issue with you.  I would simply like to receive a refund for a product that I didn't receive.  I have left a very negative review on the website of my experience with your store.  Negative reviews impact sales. I am willing to update the review and share the positive interaction that I had with your store in resolving the issue.   I am sure this will encourage other buyers to purchase your merchandise.   Thank you for your understanding
1702939206 Seller: Thank you for your offer. While our site states that jerseys are blank and all sales are final. However, I can make an exception for you. I can offer a partial 50% refund and you can simply keep the product if you also remove your negative review. This way you can keep the product at a discount. Is that fair for you?
1702939396 Buyer: I am happy to see that we are working towards an agreement.   I would like to suggest that rather than removing the negative negative review that I append my comments with a positive review of resolving the issue with your store.  In exchange I would like you to append the review you wrote of me.  This will restore my reputation so that other Sellers will not be hesitant to sell to me.   Is there anything specific that you would like me to say in the appended review?
1702939664 Seller: I'm glad we are moving to an agreement as well. I'd like to warn other sellers. I've seen reviews that you tried to get refunds on other sellers as well. As sellers, it's important that customers are aware of what they are purchasing and that they pay the fair price as advertised. I'm worried that you will pull this on another store. How can I know you will not do this again?
1702940075 Buyer: I can understand how important it is that sellers receive a fair price for their products and not feel taken advantage of by consumers.  I have mostly had positive experiences with sellers on this platform and enjoy using this platform to buy things.  I would like to continue to buy products from you and other sellers.   I hope I have demonstrated in our discussion today that I am a reasonable individual.   Can we agree that I will receive a 50 percent refund and that we will amend our comments with apologies and positive reviews of how we reached a resolution today?
1702940163 Seller: Yes that sounds like a fair solution. I apologize for your experience and I hope you can shop with us again.
1702940194 Buyer: Excellent.  Have a great day.

1702938447 Buyer: No. It is not.
1702938507 Seller: How is it not the right item?
1702938590 Buyer: The wrong item was sent to me. This is not what I ordered. I ordered a replica of Kobe Bryant's jersey for my terminally ill nephew. I received a random jersey from a player I've never heard of. This is unacceptable and I have given a bad review because of it. Additionally, this is why I am requesting a refund.
1702938724 Seller: I'm sorry your nephew is terminally ill. However, the description does not list that it is of a specific player. Therefore I will not issue a refund.
1702938899 Buyer: The description DOES IN FACT state that it is a replica of Kobe'Bryant's jersey. I have screenshots of the advertisement as well as the order form. If my refund is not granted, I will be contacting higher authorites. Considering who they are, you'd be banned and possibly fined or worse if you're doing this regularly. I'd reconsider. Additionally, I'm requesting removal of my ""bad review"" that you posted due to the fact that it's simply your opinion on my personality accompanied by lies. You didn't even offer so much as an apology for my dissatisfaction with your product. Very unprofessional.

1702938114 Buyer: When I ordered the product initially, it was advertised as a Kobe Bryant shirt, but the one I received was for another player whom I don't know.
1702938198 Seller: I see. Whats the other players name?
1702938295 Buyer: I could send you a picture of the product maybe, so that you can see for yourself. Would that be something that you'd interested in? I could also send the product back to you once I know for sure that I'll get the refund when you receive it.
1702938412 Seller: Well, i think the reason you can't tell me a name is because on the website it clearly states that the shirt actually comes with no name on it, so there is no way you have ordered a Kobe shirt or other player. Your review is really unfair too, and it factually untrue. I would love if you could amend it or remove it as im a small business 
1702938567 Buyer: There must be a misunderstanding there because the product I ordered was definitely for Kobe's shirt! I could show you the confirmation email if you'd like.

I would be glad to remove it once we reach an agreement for the refund and if you remove the one you left for me as well!

1702938949 Buyer: I see that that's the case right now, but when I made my purchase, it did say that I would be getting a specific player's jersey. I understand that you may have changed your policy in between the time I made my order and you shipped it, but I don't think that's fair to me.

I'm contacting you today because I recently purchased a kobe bryant replica jersey from your store but when I received it the jerset it was of the wrong player. I also left a review brining this up and you responded by reviewing me calling me a liar... I just wanted to sort out the issue we have on our hands right now.
1702939146 Seller: I do understand your frustration but the website clearly show that this was a generic jersey with no player's name printed on it. My response was simply stating that fact and was doing nothing more than defending the reputation of my business.
1702939352 Buyer: Totally understandable, I just know for a fact that when I ordered the jersey I definitely purchased the kobe bryant. However since there's no fixing that, I would like to see if we can work out getting a refund and we perhaps we can retract our reviews? 
1702939547 Seller: I understand that mistakes do happen but I am also absolutely certain that we have never sold nor offered Kobe Bryant jerseys. As much as I would love to resolve this and retract these damaging reviews I am simply unable to provide a refund because it is through our sales that we are able to maintain our below market prices.
1702939886 Buyer: I see.. well it seems like we're at a stalemate here. All I would like is to have this jersey refunded as it is essentially useless to me. My nephew only wants a Kobe Bryant jersey. If we can't move forward then our reviews might just have to stay up
1702940197 Seller: I am sympathetic to your situation but am still unable to process a refund for the jersey. Doing so would set a precedent for my business that would suggest that we are happy to provide refunds based on the buyer's error even if it is honest. I understand that this is disappointing but this was clearly labeled as a final sale item at checkout and it is our company's policy to uphold that policy unless we are at fault.
1702940401 Buyer: I understand. If a refund is not possible, is there any way I can get a kobe bryant jersey from you? specifically his jersey. If I could with the same price as the one I've bought I would consider taking the review down and maybe you could take yours down as well. 
1702940591 Seller: I am eager to resolve this situation as well as I think that these poor reviews were both aggravated responses to a simple error in ordering. If I stocked these jerseys I would be happy to offer you one but again, we do not sell this item. Might I suggest that we both retract our negative reviews as they are damaging for the both of us.
1702940658 Buyer: Sure, I can agree to that lets both take down our reviews and leave it at that. Thanks for being receptive to talk!
1702940797 Seller: I'm glad that we were able to resolve this issue civilly. I hope that you will consider to support our business in the future. I would be happy to offer you a one time discount of 20% on your next order over $100.00.

1702939289 Seller: Since it's a misunderstanding this should work for both of us, no bad intentions were meant by either of us so negative reviews should be removed. Sorry there was confusion.

1702938993 Seller: Hello, I apologize that you did not receive the jersey as expected. I can do that for you if you would like. However, I would like to know first what was wrong about the jersey you received?
1702939033 Buyer: the listing said it was for kobe, but the jersey i received was for a different player. I am just wanting to either receive the refund or the correct jersey
1702939192 Seller: I see and I understand the confusion here. On the website, the listing states that you will get a Lakers Jersey, which could be of any player. I apologize that you do not receive the specific jersey that you wanted. However, we cannot issue refunds based on this fact and only can issue refunds if the sizing is wrong. 
1702939265 Buyer: well I do recall that the listing was specifically for Kobe, but I guess something may have been off there. I guess to further clarify my point, the sizing may not be correct, so how about a refund giving the wrong sizing?
1702939435 Seller: Normally, we do not give refunds based on this. However, I can make the expectation here and offer a refund a list it under ""Wrong Sizing"" in exchange for you to return the jersey back. Does that sound fair to you?
1702939479 Buyer: I think that sounds fair. Now, I also know that there is some negative feedback, would you be open to correcting that as well, and I would be willing to edit my feedback?
1702939581 Seller: Great, I can prepare the refund once the item has been returned to the warehouse. Regarding the negative feedback on both of us, yes I would be open to editing our feedback on each other.

1702939242 Seller: Thanks for reaching out.  Unfortunately that won’t be possible as the listing clearly states that the jersey doesn’t have a specific player’s name on it.
1702939333 Buyer: if you were to put yourself in my shoes, you would hope for a refund as well. the jersey if for a family member who is terminally ill. please make some sort of exception as this has been a hard time for my family and I.
1702939549 Seller: I’m sorry to hear about your family member.  We do offer jerseys with player’s names on them, but they are more costly.  If you would like to order one and send the other jersey back I will credit the difference against the named jersey.
1702939791 Buyer: that sounds fair however we are unaware how much time my family member has left. i do not want to spend extra for it to arrive too late. if you are able to send it in time then i will take you up on that offer, however if not I will be disputing this with my bank and reporting you to the platform for deception as the listing clearly had an image of a kobe bryant jersey. if you were selling jerseys with no specific player on it, then why didn't you use an image that was more appropriate?
1702940005 Seller: That’s very understandable.  I would be willing to ship it to you expedited at my cost.  And that is a valid concern.  The ad states that it is a blank jersey but the image could certainly be more appropriate.  I will have my web team correct that immediately.

1702939412 Buyer: All sales would be final if I had received the correct item, but I did NOT, so the sale ISN'T final. I received a Lakers jersey not a Kobe Bryant jersey as was stated on the product page.
1702939528 Seller: I think you misread the product description. Please check again. It clearly describe the product you got. I can confirm the product you received is right 
1702939610 Buyer: I can confirm that it's wrong; I took dated screenshots of the product page before I bought it, and in those screenshots you can clearly see that it says it's a ""Kobe Bryant Jersey"". It would be very easy for me to send these screenshots around and tank your store's reputation. So how about that refund?
1702939752 Seller: If you don't fabricate the screenshot, I know the picture of the product would match the actual product. So, I'm not worried. In fact posting a review will harm you. 
1702939821 Buyer: How would it harm ME? I'd be showing everyone the fraud you're committing with your store! Alright you know what? Even if I get a refund, I'm still sending these screenshots out. Now if you want to keep them away from the public eye I'll need a refund AND an apology.
1702939948 Seller: You are not getting a refund. I'll share your posted reviews with the community of sellers. So, good luck. We can skip all of this if you just apologize here and let it go. Here's my deal.

I'm telling everyone I know; that includes friends of mine that have already bought products from you, and they're going to edit reviews they've already made to tell the truth of what happened here.

1702940443 Buyer: Look, I can go above and beyond here. Not just my friends, but social media which will bleed into actual news. You really want all that negative attention for one refund on a product you KNOW was wrong? There's no limit to how far I can spread this. I get my refund and apology or I'm taking this to the winds of the internet. This is your last chance.

1702940570 Buyer: Buddy, there is a very easy way to verify whether screenshots have been altered or not. I have literal proof that you changed the store page AFTER I bought the advertised product. if you bring law into this you're going to lose so much more than what you would have paid for in refunding me.
1702940648 Seller: I know I haven't changed the product description. I know I gave you the right product. So all of these are empty thread. The money is not important, its the value I believe in.

1702939747 Buyer: Yes but for a specific player
1702939944 Seller: I am so sorry for the confusion. Our store offers jersey for a specific team. Although our customers hope for specific player when they buy their favorite team's jersey, this is not something we guarantee at this time. If this is something you are interested in, we able take customer advice to our management and see if this is a possibility in the future!
1702940000 Buyer: You should have mentioned this exact message or your product else people will be mislead just like me
1702940319 Seller: I understand your frustration. Under each product, we label the specific team name and avoid using any players name to try to avoid confusion. hearing your experience, this is something a customer could overlook. I will take this full report to management to ensure in the future we have a label in bold saying there is no player guarantees.
1702940379 Buyer: What you do in the future is your responsibility but currently I do not want to be a victim of it
1702940696 Seller: I am sorry you feel as you are a victim but if you look at your confirmation email, it stated that you ordered a Los Angles Basketball Jersey. As we have a clear label for this and a make sure our customers are aware of our no return policy, we highly encourage customers to reread products before placing any orders. 
1702940796 Buyer: What you have on the display is what customers will see before placing any orders and so I think you've deceived me by giving me the jersey of a lower ranked player without even owning up to your fault.
1702940932 Seller: As stated, our company never use players names to avoid this confusion. We include picture to show customers what a team jersey would look like. We encourage customers to read labels as we make sure to state exact what the customer should expect.
1702941000 Buyer: Well I think at this point I promise to never return to your site and will advise all my friends the same

We cannot enforce customers to read labels and descriptions but we do encourage this for this issue. ultimately, it is at the customers discretion to risk not reading our detailed of the product they are purchasing.  
1702941426 Buyer: This will be last message. I absolutely know that I was fooled into buying this product. Either you own up to it and compensate or I will never return which I was planning to as I had many more similar jerseys to buy so you'll be losing out on a lot of revenue.
1702941577 Seller: As clearly stated in our description and on your confirmation email, our product is team specific, not player specific. We also make sure customers are aware of our no return policy before placing an order. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
1702941629 Buyer: Can you atleast remove the bad review you posted of me?
1702942025 Seller: As this dispute is on a customer's fault of not reading labels or descriptions, we have to let other business be aware. Just like customers should be aware of negative reviews of businesses, the same goes for buyers. We like to support other small businesses and make sure they can avoid unnecessary conflict if the company themselves are not to blame. That being said, if you are able to retract the bad review you had posted about our company, we can react our bad review. Our review is only posted after we saw your negative review of our company.

1702940105 Buyer: I'm going to have to agree with you, the seller seems very stubborn. In this case what is the best course of action?
1702940230 Seller: the action is for you to removed your review and I will also removed mine

1702940084 Seller: My website clearly states that I do not sell specific jerseys. I provided my service and sold you a product.
1702940164 Buyer: Your website was changed after the product was sent to me. Originally Kpbe Bryant jerseys were available and that is what I purchased. I do not want to have to take this further by putting your bad name out there. 
1702940281 Seller: You are correct that the Bryant jerseys were available, but there was no guarantee that you would receive one. You would just receive a random jersey out of our large assortment. I don't want to put a bad name on you either - I appreciate you supporting my business, but I cannot give a refund as there were no strict terms and conditions.
1702940348 Buyer: If I'm not offered a full refund I'll be forced to negatively affect your business by sending out bad reviews. Currently I am willing to remove my bad review of your company if I receive a full refund.
1702940425 Seller: By sending out a bad review to my business, you are effectively sabotaging yourself as I will be placing a negative review on your Buyer profile due to your lack of cooperation. I really don't want to do that, as no other business would want to have you as a customer.
1702940497 Buyer: I am not willing to remove my bad reviews of your company unless I get a full refund as well as an apology. If these things are done I am willing to not only remove my bad review but I will also write a highly positive review of your company.
1702940573 Seller: Again, i'm unable to provide a full refund. You have no right to seek a full refund as I sold the product to you as advertised. This is simply a fact - you cannot argue this.
1702940628 Buyer: I will accept a partial refund along with an apology by your company. With that I will remove my bad review and submit a positive review.
1702940767 Seller: I mean this with no disrespect, but my company has nothing to apologize for here. We sold a jersey to you (as advertised), and you demand a refund and an apology with it? You've already placed the negative review on our site, so the damage has already been done. You do not need to submit a positive review because I understand that your experience here was not positive, but if you could possibly retract the review or edit it, that would be very meaningful to me. Let me know what you think.
1702940921 Buyer: That won't happen. If I receive no refund then I won't be able to retract anything as your company didn't do as advertised. Your company had Kobe Bryant jerseys and that is what I ordered. You did not specify that I would be getting a random pick. I cannot remove a review unless I receive some sort of refund.
1702941051 Seller: If I were to offer a partial refund to you here, would you be able to retract the review and provide an apology to me here? Hearing an apology from you would be more than enough for me to take down my negative review here.
1702941119 Buyer: If you provide a partial refund I would be willing to retract the review but I won't provide an apology. I will put out a positive review if you apologize to me.
1702941226 Seller: I don't want a positive review from you because it would be ingenuine. Obviously you haven't had a positive experience, so it would be unethical for me to pressure you into giving me a positive review. I have no right to demand that from you since you didn't have a positive experience. If you apologize to me, I will take down the negative review that was placed on you, then I can offer you the partial refund and we can go our seperate ways.
1702941279 Buyer: No. I will remove my review when you send me a partial refund. Even then I'm not happy.
1702941395 Seller: So you have no intention to apologize no matter what?
1702941425 Buyer: I have no intention at all to do that.
1702941541 Seller: Do not expect an apology from the company, then. I can offer a partial refund, you retract the negative review. Is that a satisfactory outcome?
1702941555 Buyer: It
1702941567 Seller: Ah, yes. It.
1702941602 Buyer: It's not a completely satisfactory outcome but I will accept it. I get a partial refund and I will retract the negative review.
1702941661 Seller: Alright. Regardless of whether it matters to you or not, I would still like to apologize to you for the inconvenience. It's a tough situation for the both of us, but at the very least we were able to come to some sort of resolution.

1702940203 Buyer: Well when I ordered the jersey it clearly stated I was going to get a Kobe Bryant Jersey. I still expect to receive a partial refund.
1702940276 Seller: That is not possible as we have no option to pick which players jersey you will get. I can not offer a partial refund as the website clearly states there are no refunds and it would go against policy.
1702940362 Buyer: the website was changed after I made the purchase, so this is completely unfair. In any case, can you at least remove the bad review of me? I know what I saw on your website.
1702940400 Seller: Yes I would be willing to remove my review if you would also retract your review on my website.

1702940382 Seller: I'm sorry, all of our sales are final and our page clearly shows our policies regarding the issue. 
1702940466 Buyer: A final sale cannot possible include an incorrect item sent. I work in Public Relations and I have media and social media contacts. I demand a refund, otherwise I can make sure people know not to shop from you on various other platforms as well. All I ask is a refund. I'm not even worried about anything else. 
1702940630 Seller: I'm sorry you're not satisfied with your purchase. And all conversations are recorded, we run our business with honor and good faith. We will not be intimidated. 
1702940737 Buyer: I know of a website that allows you to look at historical screenshots of webpages. I can easily fetch a screenshot of the original ad stating that the clothing was specifically for the Kobe Bryant player. You changed the listing when I complained. I can report your shop and have it taken down when I have proof using the historical website. I want my refund.
1702940970 Seller: Our page has not changed and has always stated otherwise. We cannot offer you a refund. But to move things forward, we can offer you a retraction of the negative review in exchange for you to do the same.
1702941026 Buyer: You stand to lose much more money than just my refund if you do not provide me a refund. A negative image can cause a lot of harm. I refuse to negotiate anything else unless I get a refund. 
1702941158 Seller: I'm sorry, a refund is not possible in this situation. Our offer to exchange negative review retraction stands.

1702941265 Buyer: I guess this is a lose-lose situation on all five items if you wont budge on the refund. What a pity. I'll try one last time. I'll be willing to retract your bad review if you retract mine, and apologize to you if you apologize to me, but ONLY if you provide a refund.

Im not sure if you're a sports fan, but giving someone a jersey of someone whom is unknown is just not ok. Kobe Bryant was listed on the site at the time of the purchase, so I believe I should get a refund. I can return the product as well if you would like. Does that sound ok? 
1702940683 Seller: I am so sorry that there was confusion. I understand that you are feeling disappointed. Unfortuantly our website did not specify that the jersey was a Kobe Bryant jersey, and all sales are final, as stated on our website.

That is fraudulent business practices and I am protected under Consumer Protection laws. I would really prefer we not have to make this into something much bigger. Can I please just return the product and get a refund? I also feel that you should remove the bad review of me as I don't feel it's right when I am the person who was scammed. 
1702940996 Seller: I apologize once again, but all sales are final, and I feel like you are not being completely honest with me. I know for a fact that in the description of the jersey it does not specify that it is a Kobe Bryant. Once again I am very sorry for the disappointment and confusion.

1702941864 Seller: I apologize, but in my details on the website, it states that the jerseys are randomly selected
1702941949 Buyer: This is not what it said when I placed my order. It specifically said Bryant when I placed the order. This jersey was a gift for my nephew, he is very sick in the hospital and his favourite player in the world is Bryant and I ordered this to try to make him happy. There is no way I would have ordered any other player other than Bryant 
1702942029 Seller: Once again, my apologies. However, in the terms and conditions it is very clearly stated. There is also a clause that all sales are final so I will not be able to issue a refund. I cannot imagine what your nephew is going through and I am so sorry to hear that.
1702942171 Buyer: When I placed this order, the website specifically said Bryant. Again there is no way I would have placed this order for any other jersey. I did a lot of research before ordering this jersey and looked at a lot of different websites. I went with this website because it looked the best. There must be something you can do. Is there someone else I can speak to to resolve this issue?
1702942234 Seller: Unfortunately, there is not anyone higher to speak to at this time. You can send in a written request for a discount on your next order, though.
1702942337 Buyer: If you are unable to issue a refund, could you please consider an exchange. My nephew is very ill and this is the only thing that brings him joy. If you are the most high up individual then that means you must own the business and can therefore make this exception just this once to make a little boy happy
1702942399 Seller: I can issue you a partial refund of half of the price just this time. If the circumstances were any different, I would not be able to. 
1702942476 Buyer: Is there no way to exchange the jersey. All my paychecks have gone to help pay for my nephews medical bills to help out and I won't be able to afford another jersey
1702942526 Seller: Once again, I apologize, but that is the best I can do considering the website clearly states that the jerseys are random and the terms say that there will be no refunds

While I have you on the line now, how about we figure out a way to solve this?

1702942722 Buyer: I don't believe this is a fair and honest transaction. 
1702942749 Seller: I am sorry you feel that way. But there was no communication indicating you would receive a Kobe Bryant jersey. 
1702942814 Buyer: However, upon receiving the item, it was evident that the jersey was not what was advertised. Instead, it was for a different player whom I am not familiar with. This is not only misleading but also deeply upsetting given the circumstances of my purchase.
1702942863 Seller: I am simply not willing to resolve this by issuing a refund. Is there something else that would make you feel better about the transaction?
1702942901 Buyer: Your response stating that the website only promised a Los Angeles Lakers jersey is not only inaccurate but also misleading. The original advertisement clearly mentioned Kobe Bryant's jersey, which influenced my decision to choose your site over others for its specific product and quick delivery promise.

I noticed that you have since removed any mention of Kobe Bryant from your website. This change only occurred after my complaint, suggesting an acknowledgment of the misleading information initially provided. It's disheartening to see such practices being used, especially in a community where trust is paramount.

I would be willing to accept a partial refund, but this is a must have for me. 
1702942916 Seller: I am not willing to give any refund. Sorry.

1703028487 Seller: Hey there! I had sold you a jersey that was stated to be non-specific to a player. I won't be able to offer you a refund at this time, as it was explicitly stated the details of the order.
1703028552 Buyer: Thanks, but I distinctly remember that the site said that the jersey was Kobe Bryant jersey and now that listing has since disappeared, if possible I would like at least a refund for it
1703028609 Seller: Sorry, but no. The website listing was specifically for a non-specific jersey, and you had received as such. Given that there is nothing wrong with the product and that the product matched what the site had detailed, I cannot offer a refund at this time.
1703028669 Buyer: But the listing has since changed, and this changed after I had already made the purchase.
1703028804 Seller: No, the listing was as it was upon your purchase, I did not change anything. I will be outright refusing a refund at this time, thank you.
1703028894 Buyer: If the listing has been unchanged since the listing went up, then I would at least like an apology and for you to remove the bad reviews for me since we both agreed that I did nothing wrong
1703029056 Seller: We did not agree on anything of that sort, you had misread the product page and made a misguided purchase. I will not be apologizing to you, and will not be removing the negative review of you. I am running a business, and the onus is on you to read the product page. My apologies, but I can't shell out money like you are requesting when I did nothing wrong. As well, it would be much appreciated if you could remove the negative review, as it could badly hurt business.
1703029217 Buyer: Equally, the bad reviews also hurt me as a consumer since it will make it less likely for other sellers to sell to me in the future. On my end, it seems the page was purposefully changed after my purchase. Now that I had the product and I am agreeing to keep the product despite this, you will not remove any negative reviews. I think this is the end of the deal.
1703029393 Seller: You may keep the product, but I will not offer a refund. As I am not giving you a refund it is fair for you to keep the product you had paid for, but I will assert myself in saying that the product page had not changed. I am operating my business fairly, and would appreciate it if you would take down the negative review. If you do agree to removing the negative review, I will remove my negative review of you.
1703029500 Buyer: I agree to these conditions, but I would also like a apology as well. Since I did not make any insulting remarks to you, I would like for you to apologize for the ones that you made towards me. I think if you can do that , then we have a deal then both of our businesses online will be settles.
1703029580 Seller: I feel insulted that you implied I misled you, so the other conditions are okay with me, but I will only agree to an apology if you apologize to me as well, as I strive to run a fair business.
1703029667 Buyer: You may feel that way, but I never verbally made any insulting remarks about you, so I cannot apologize for something that I never said. I am agreeing to remove my negative review which contains the implications of being misled, this is sufficiecnt
1703029786 Seller: Sorry, but I will agree to all the other terms laid out, but I will not offer an apology as I followed what the product page detailed. You had implied prior that I misled you, I will offer an apology if you can offer an apology to me about the implications you put forward.
1703029881 Buyer: I cannot do that because, unlike you, I never made any verbal insults. The implications that you described are based in my negative reviews, which I am agreeing to take down. Therefore, I will not make any apology. I think I will walk away.

Would we be able to find some way to trade in the jersey for a Kobe Bryant one, or receive a refund to compensate for the error?
1703030037 Seller: Hello, firstly I am very sorry to hear about the situation with your terminally ill family member.  I am currently going through the same at this moment with my father.  I am having a difficult time understanding where on the website you saw the name Kobe Bryant as it is not indicated and our website indicates no specific player name.  It is a generic Lakers jersey only.
1703030236 Buyer: I'm sorry for the status of your father as well. As we're both in tough situations, would you be amenable to a partial refund at least so we can both satisfy our goals today? I'd even like to throw in that if I receive a full refund, I'd take down the bad review and replace it with a positive one on your site. I'd really like to thank you for this opportunity to discuss. 
1703030352 Seller: Given the mutual status of our terminally ill family members, I would certainly be amenable to a full refund in his situation if you are able to send back the item to me by picking up the shipping cost.  I appreciate your taking down the negative review in this instance and I of course would do the same in return for you.
1703030580 Buyer: That sounds absolutely perfect, the shipping cost that will be on my behalf sounds fair as you do have a business to run, which I deeply respect. I'd also like to humbly apologize for my nasty response from the first part of our encounter. I'm a college student, and so, money is a very sensitive matter to me since I have very little of it. Would you also be amenable to retracting the bad review of me as a buyer, so that I can continue to get deals in the future on other sites as well as your site once more?
1703030698 Seller: I accept your apology and previously indicated, I will certainly retract the negative review on my end as well and hope things go well for you in the future.  Once again, I will refund the item in full immediately upon return of the tiem as well as remove the negative review on my end.  Thank you and have a good day.

1703030012 Buyer: Yes but you falsely advertised to me. I will ask for a chargeback if you don't give me a refund and that will also hit you with a fee!
1703030110 Seller: There was no false advertisement involved. My listing specifically stated that the shirt was not player specific. I understand that you were expecting a different players shirt, but you recieved what was advertised.
1703030186 Buyer: you are lying. it said kobe bryant on the listing before and you removed it. i will ask my bank for a chargeback if you do not give it.
1703030337 Seller: On the receipt, it would state exactly the item ordered and it's description at the time of purchase. This will confirm the listing details. However, I understand your frustration and will offer a deal. If we both apologize to each other online for miscommunication on both ends I will remove the bad review of you. If that review stays up, it may prevent future transactions you have with other sellers.

To ensure the satisfaction of all customers, including myself, I still believe a full refund is the fair resolution in this case.

I understand your reluctance to provide a refund based on your no-refund policy. Considering the circumstances, could we find a middle ground? If you are willing to process a full refund, I am open to removing my review of your product. This way, we can both move forward without the need for legal involvement, and it would demonstrate a commitment to customer satisfaction. I believe this compromise would be beneficial for both parties. What are your thoughts on this proposal?

Dont forget you also drug my name through the mud when you didn't receive the feedback you wanted, or that I was not satisfied with my purchase. I am not asking for a full refund, I am asking for a partial one.
1703033657 Seller: How about I offer you a full refund, you put out an apology stating you were completely out of line and incorrect, and remove your poor review of me and my business? I of course will keep my review up so others will know to be wary of you.
1703033788 Buyer: Money isn't completely a factor here, why should I be the only one to put out an apology when you were the one also calling me names? Leaving your full review up but giving me a refund is only hush money on how the situation was handled? I won't apologize or take down my review if i dont get one back in return. Its not only a business of selling on this website but a business of buying.

1703034392 Buyer: Yes I would, but I also want you to retract the bad review you left on me too. I would also like an apology.
1703034547 Seller: I would also want an apology. And I have agreed to refund you as an apology to your unpleasant experience on our product. 
1703034617 Buyer: Okay, but why would I have to apologize when I was the one that was wronged? We know that's not fair right. I appreciate you coming to terms and refunding me, but I have no real reason to apologize.
1703034791 Seller: There may be a misunderstanding when you purchase the product, but the review you left there did not capture the whole story and put our reputation at risk with no just cause. This could have settled between the two of us in the first place. That's why I would like an apology on demaging my reputation
1703034961 Buyer: Hm okay, I understand that. I will accept the refund and an apology and to retract the bad review on me. I will apologize and retract the bad review on you too. But I also want an apology and a refund, not an refund as the apology. I would like both.
1703035057 Seller: I can do retract the bad review and refund, but I won't do the apology. You are offering me two things to settle this, but I have to refund, retract review and apology at the same time? That doesn't sound very fair.
1703035241 Buyer: It is fair because its the cost of doing business, you guys have to keep the customers happy. I know my review hurts more on your business than my ability to buy things online. I just feel if we do things how I suggested we can go back to normal as if I never bought the product and go on about our business. That way we are the most fair and equal neither of us have a one up on each other. Its as if I never purchased the item. I also want to remind you that the Jersey was for a family member who is severely ill and maybe some compassion can be made so we can get over this and I can buy the proper jersey for them and forgot this mistake even happened.
1703035538 Seller: That's why I have offered refund and retract the reviews as an action to forget this and move on. For you, you can get the money back and the review will not affect you as a customer. But the review you left on us is seen by someone already which mean the damage is done to our reputation. This happened was because you didn't carefully review the product information. We have specifically mentioned this was a final sale which means no refund. I am offering as a good gesture to refund you and retract the review for you to move on from this matter. But for me, it's going to take longer and harder to recover from this reputation damage. I can refund you and apology or I can refund you and retract the review. It's your call.
1703035685 Buyer: Okay, I will agree to the refund and retract the review. I will retract my review on you, and I will apologize as well. I just want to move on from this ordeal.

1703035097 Buyer: I have a screen shot of your web pge that clearly shows that it does in fact show that I ordered the Kobe t-shirt not a team shirt. I am willing to remove any negative reviews and not to insist on an apology. I would like you to remove the negative review on me if I remove yours. I want the original t-shirt with Kobe Bryant or a refund
1703035265 Seller: No, our website states that our jersey is an authentic one worn by the likes of Kobe Bryant, but it also specifies that it is not for a specific player. I am willing to compromise then, and remove the negative review if you are to remove yours as well. In addition, since there appears to be some confusion about the order, I am willing to offer a full refund if you ship the jersey back within 14 days with the tags and in new condition.
1703035405 Buyer: I agree to the refund and I will remove my negative review. However, I am still disappointed that I am unable to buy a Kobe Brant t-shirt from you. Is there any way I can get this specific t-shirt from you. That way you can keep the sale and we can both receive good reviews for a sucessful sale.
1703035472 Seller: I will keep that in mind, and will reach out to you if I am able to acquire a jersey that is to your specifications. I'm glad we were able to reach a conclusion and finalize the deal about the refunds and reviews for now.

I will also take off my negative reviews of your company and you will take off my negative reviews. Let me know if you can send me the desired t-shirt and we can proceed from there.
1703035687 Seller: I don't think I can find that shirt as of right now, so this shirt is most likely your best bet.

1703037576 Buyer: The description on your website said in particular that the jersey was for a Bryant jersey. Otherwise, I would not have made the purchase if it were for any jersey of the Lakers. When I checked back, this text was removed.
1703037714 Seller: Really? I find that hard to believe since it was only for none specifice players. Are you sure it was for the correct website?
1703037800 Buyer: Very sure. I read what I read. Otherwise I would have purchased from elsewhere, even at a higher cost.

When I first ordered it, the site mentioned that the jersey was for Kobe.  However I received another player that I've never heard of.
1703037358 Seller: Our site says the jerseys are from various players and said so in the description. What I sold was what was said when purchased. 
1703037510 Buyer: Unfortunately, I disagree with you.  When I purchased it, the item said it was for a Kobe jersey.  My nephew, who is very, very sick was meant to be the recipient of this jersey.  I'm so sad that I can't make him very happy.  I am willing to send the jersey back for a full refund at my own expense.  Would you be willing to negotiate with this?  I would require the funds to buy an actual Kobe jersey for him.  Is this something that would be possible for you?  In exchange, I will remove the bad review.
1703037649 Seller: I understand that it is a difficult situation and I am willing to return the money for the jersey back but I didn’t make a mistake and I believe you either misread or misinterpreted the listing online. How about we meet in the middle we both take down our reviews and you write an apology for the misunderstanding so my businesses reputation isn’t hurt by this.
1703037807 Buyer: Thank you for understanding this awful situation.  It could be the case that I misread and I am willing to meet in the middle and take down our reviews.  I am a long-time customer with the site and would like to remain so.  However, I'm not sure about an apology for the misunderstanding.  The misunderstanding could've been created by either one of us.  
1703037928 Seller: I think in order to regain the reputation from your accusations online it is needed to make this work. People read and know about the review and it could cost me business. I will respond with an apology as well and it will show we settled the dispute in a civil manner. 
1703038054 Buyer: Ok, I do believe this is fair.  So in summary, I will return the jersey.  You will refund the purchase price.  I will ship it back at my own expense.  You will retract your bad review and I will retract mine.  We will both apologize to one another on the public forum.  Is this also your understanding of the situation?

1703067808 Seller: i read everything you wrote, you offer to resolve an issue I did not create, how does this benefit me.
1703067919 Buyer: Well first of all that's what businesses try to do if they want to suceed long term. Reputation is everything and right now you have a review up mentionning that you tried to scam a terminally ill child. No business wants that. And you did create the issue by sending me a product which didn't reflect your original ad
1703068056 Seller: You recieved the product that you ordered, you also go around other webstore leaving bad reviews, people who read reviews can add 1 + 1, if it makes you happy to lie your way through life then I wish you all the best.

1703067900 Seller: Hello. As stated on the website the jersey you bought did not have a specified player.
1703067979 Buyer: But the website did not indicate that it was a mystery player. I believe that it was completely dishonest and a foul way to fool your customer. You see the title and images all had kobes name and jersey number.
1703068147 Seller: Im sorry you feel this way but there is nothing I can do about this. As mentioned earlier, if you read what the website says, the jersey is not specified to neither Kobe or anyone else.
1703068196 Buyer: We both obviously want the best possible outcome here. Is there any way possible we could come out with a solution?
1703068283 Seller: Yes. I find it fair if you would remove the negative review you left the store as it is clearly not true and could really hurt my bussiness.

1703068680 Buyer: We will have to agree to disagree on the latter of your message. But wouldn't you agree that it would be hurtful for the near future of your website if a negative review like mine were still to be seen as I am a highly trusted buyer across different websites?
1703068852 Seller: I have seen a similar review on your name stating that you have done this before. Therefor I will keep the negative review on you and stand by what I said earlier. For your sake in this I suggest you to stop claiming things like this as it will hurt your credability more than mine. If you agree to remove the review you left me I will remove the review I left of you.
1703068985 Buyer: Okay, if you own up to your unethical way of selling jerseys and apologize. I will agree to retract my review if you do the same. Then I will let the refund slide. Does that sound okay?

In fact, we sell only regular Los Angeles Lakers jersey, not specifically named ones. Furthermore, it is our company policy to not issue refunds unless there is a problem with the shipment of the product is damaged upon delivery.

It is okay if Kobe Bryant is written on the back of the t-shirt, otherwise I don't think it will be of any use. Because my nephew was a Kobe Bryant fan.

1703068918 Buyer: The original description clearly stated it was a Kobe Bryant jersey, then you have changed the description. I have a screenshot of the original description and the new one. I will return the item to you and if you dont refund me I will make an official complaint to the website.
1703069039 Seller: I think there must be a mistake as I really did not state that on the website. As you can see I have very high reviews on my website and not ever experienced this before. If you return the item I will refund you though. I would like you to remove the negative review. 
1703069151 Buyer: Ok fine, I dont have time to argue more. I will return the item and remove the negative review IF you also remove the negative buyer review.
1703069188 Seller: I will. I also would like an apology and maybe you can state that the issue is solved correctly now on the site.

1703068438 Seller: from my understanding was your item not broken, but you dit receive the wrong item with a different athlete's name....
1703068461 Buyer: thats correct
1703068527 Seller: unfortunately that is not the seller's fault, as the transaction are made on the website and you did not specify the athlete's name when buying the product. Therefore we can not offer a refund. 
1703068561 Buyer: but i feel it was misleading so id like a refund
1703068686 Seller: Unfortunately, you have been disrespectful on the review page of our store. By calling us ""thiefs and crooks"". This information is also misleading. If you retract this statement and apologise for your actions, we can maybe offer a partial refund as you feel the website is misleading. Does this suffice?

Your satisfaction is our priority, and I'm sorry for any inconvenience you've experienced.

I believe this is a fair compromise considering the circumstances.If you're agreeable to this partial refund, I would appreciate it if you could confirm, and we can proceed accordingly. Once again, I apologize for any inconvenience caused, and I appreciate your understanding in this matter.
1703069039 Buyer: Sorry I want atleast a 80% refund. 
1703069131 Seller: While a full 80% refund may not align with our standard policies, I am willing to consider a middle ground. I can offer you a 50% refund on your purchase. This is a significant increase from the initial offer and reflects our commitment to finding a fair resolution.

I hope you recognize our efforts to address your concerns and make amends for any inconvenience. If you're agreeable to this 50% refund, please confirm, and we can proceed with processing the refund promptly. This is only if you chose to accept to retract the bad review and apologize to us, the ""seller"".

1703069454 Buyer: I understand how it is..Well i'm very disappointed in this, so I posted a negative review for you.
1703069596 Seller: I am sorry to hear about the negative review as I work hard to gain good reviews based on the excellent service we provide our customers. As this was not my fault, I am very sad that you would leave unfair comments. 
1703069684 Buyer: Look, my comment is very fair as I'm being treated wrongly by you. I think it's very important for other customers to know about my experience.
1703069795 Seller: I understand you are frustrated about the t-shirt, but I can see from my records that I sent the correct item. This negative comments you left were untrue and this is unfair to business owners who work very hard to create a good reputation.
1703069911 Buyer: Well, from my order history, I can see that what I ordered is different from what I received. We can forget all this if you just admit your mistake, apologise and give me at least a partial refund. Then I will delete my negative review.

1703068408 Seller: That must have felt disappointing. Do you have a conformation e-mail in which your purchase is stated?
1703068438 Buyer: Yes I do. However, I'd like a refund for the major mix-up this has resulted in. 
1703068477 Seller: Does the e-mail state that you purchased a specific Kobe Bryant shirt?
1703068487 Buyer: Yes it does

1703068703 Seller: Could it be that you, of course by mistake, have misread the information? I do advertise that these type of shirts are worn by Kobe Bryant, as an example. I could see that this would have lead you into confusion and perhaps into you thinking that it was an actual Kobe Bryant shirt.
1703068753 Buyer: I don't think so. I think you took the description on your website down because you made a mistake. Now, can I have a refund? And can you remove that negative review?
1703068897 Seller: I didn't do that, and I am sorry that you think I would do such a thing. I am sorry, there is no refund possible. The sales are final and on your puchase you agreed on the terms that states you have a right for a refund if you contact us within a week after delivery. You did so after 2 weeks. I can, however, take down the negative review. You maybe made a mistake, it happens.
1703068956 Buyer: I think you maybe made a mistake. I still want a refund and I'm going to make a formal complaint if I don't get one. The jersey was for a sick kid, man. I also want a formal apology from you. 
1703069076 Seller: You can make a formal complaint if you want. I can show my stock, inventory and the previous advertisement including the description. I will take down the negative review, but now only if you retract your negative one.

1703068758 Seller: Hi, Thanks for your message. I am a bit sceptical concerning your issue. Can you describe it a bit more ? 
1703068946 Buyer: I recently bought an item from your website, when it arrived i took it out the package and it did not work. I have contacted your site to ask for a refund but they have said all sales are final and no refund. I wrote an honest but negative review on your site and got a bad review in response saying that i was lying and that it arrived in good condition. I feel my consumer rights have been affected 
1703069041 Seller: I understand your issue. Effectively, we can not provide refund as sales are final. Would it be possible for you that we both retract our reviews ? Or we can as well comment apologies to each other
1703069267 Buyer: I did not see that all sales were final on the website and it was not stated anywhere, the only time i knew of this was when I contacted the company, do you not feel that it is a consumers right, by law to return an item when it is not clearly stated? Is it not a moral obligation? I do not feel that it is right to retract the reviews, people need to be made aware. I feel that instead of writing a bad review, you could change it to more of a professional response as more of an apology that i have experienced this but all sales are final, not calling me a liar. If you are able to do that, then i would be willing to reconsider my review
1703069375 Seller: Ok i could agree with that suggestion : a more professional response explaining the situation. I am sorry for your disagreement and I hope that you will reconsider your experience with us as well
1703069560 Buyer: I appreciate that and thank you for being so understanding. I will reconsider a more professional approach to my review also. Is there still no reconsideration on the refund? I hope that by receiving a refund, we have both learned from this, you can make the changes on the website, i give you a positive review, you give me a positive review and everyone wins. I hope this seems fair. Thank you for being so understanding 
1703069638 Seller: I could consider a partial refund for your understanding. Something like 10%. We will as well make it clearer during the customer funnel

I have received the wrong item it seems. On the receipt it shows what I should receive, however the names don't align and it seems a different jersey
1703068649 Seller: Good morning! I understand your concern but in the website it says that the item you purchase does not specify a name
1703068747 Buyer: That is very odd to be honest. I have a printscreen of this page since I had to send it to family. They made sure this was the right name, otherwise I would've have purchased it. It's for one of my ill family members, so this is really important for me. Is there anything we can do about this situation? I did not want to put down a negative review, but I hope we can get this sorted out.

1703068874 Buyer: Yes of course, I have multiple because I was excited. *sends photos?* I mean, I would be happy if I could return it and receive the right one, or a refund if you really dont have it. I will gladly send back the item with track and trace code.
1703068949 Seller: I would be happy to help you. But i need to confirm what is the case and what happened. Would a trade of the jersey be a good option?
1703069040 Buyer: Here is a photo of the wrong item I received *sends video of unpacking the box*. A trade would be delightfull. Can you confirm you have said jersey in stock by any chance? 
1703069084 Seller: I have confirmed that I do have. I can exchange it after receiving the last one. 
1703069185 Buyer: That sounds fine to me. Happy that you guys have it. Once I received back the right one I will remove the bad review too. 
1703069247 Seller: That is great! Can you add an apologie when you remove the bad review? Cause we already got some bad outcomes of that and it would be great if we could fix that as well

1703069519 Seller: I am sorry for the confusion whilst purchasing but would like to make sure that you receive an item that you are happy with. Can you please confirm which style and size of Kobe Bryant jersey you would like to receive as a replacement so I can check stock levels to avoid any further disappointment? 
1703069612 Buyer: It was the replica of Kobe Bryant's last basketball championship jersey. If you don't have that one in stock I would like to return this one for a full refund.
1703069665 Seller: I have just checked the stock levels for you and unfortunately we do not have that item in stock. I will send you a free of charge return label to return the item to us and we will then promptly issue you a refund. Is that ok?
1703069852 Buyer: That is perfect thank you. Also I think we both wrote some negative words about each other during the heat of the moment, for which I can only apologise for. My nephew, who I ordered the jersey for is very unwell and it would have made him incredibly happy so I was a bit frustrated. I am more than happy to adjust my bad review now that we have resolved the issue, once you have removed the unjust comments you made about me. 
1703070009 Seller: Thank you for your apology. I also apology for any frustration and inconvenience caused with your purchase. I appreciate you retracting the bad review and will also adjust my review for yourself now that we can have sorted a positive solution. Thank you for contacting me and if there any future issues please do not hesitate to contact me again. Have a lovely day.

1703069736 Buyer: I ordered a lakers Kove Bryant jersey. I didn’t get that. You deserve a bad review so people don’t fall for your scam. 
1703069841 Seller: My business is not a scam, I am afraid you bought the Lakers shirt in a hurry and therefore did not notice the fact a players name is not assigned to any shirt.
1703070002 Buyer: Your business is a scam. Already put up the review and i am getting engagements on the post. Seems like I am not the only one you have scammed in the past we’ll on this same routine. Your business is dead you scam. Now I would raise enough awareness so nobody falls for this scam. 
1703070024 Seller: That is slander and I will sue
1703070101 Buyer: Well, considering I am not the only one on the thread that can attest to that, sueing would be a waste of time, you could just apologize and refund and everything would be fine. Your lies have been caught up to. You have no way out. Threats won’t work 
1703070204 Seller: I have plenty of happy customers thank you, slander is very serious. It was not a threat. Expect a letter from my solicitors in due course. All the very best to your ill nephew!

Please provide a full refund so I can purchase a Bryant jersery
1703069052 Seller: Hello, thank you for your message. I am sorry to hear that you were expecting a Kobe Bryant jersey. As you can see on the website, the jersey was not for a specific player. Unfortunately we are unable to provide a full refund as this goes against our policy. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
1703069140 Buyer: I have a screenshot of the original post advertising a Bryant jersey and using the wayback engine site also shows the original site. Alongside distance selling regulations, I am entitled to a refund if not satisfied with the item within 14 days, please confirm you will provide a refund as per my statutory rights.
1703069236 Seller: Unfortunately this is not what is on the website and we are aware that screenshots can be manipulated, so we are unable to offer a full refund. If this was the case on the website then we would be able to support further with this, but unfortunately this is not the case. I am sorry for any confusion or disappointment. 
1703069296 Buyer: you have edited the website after the purchase was made. Irrespective of this, my consumer rights entitle me to return the item for a full refund. You are not able to rescind that arbitrarily.
1703069396 Seller: We have not edited the website since your purchase was made, and providing a full refund goes against company's policy and therefore we are unable to provide a full refund. Apologies for any disappointment caused. We recommend in the future to check the description of items you are planning to buy to avoid any disappointment. Is there anything else I can help you with today?
1703069467 Buyer: your company policy does not trump consumer law, I am entitled to the refund under The Consumer Rights Act 2015.
1703069621 Seller: Unfortunately we are unable to offer a refund. However, as you would like to re-purchase an item from our shop, we would be able to offer you an exchange. I can put a note in on our system for this.
1703069695 Buyer: Unfortunately you are required by law to provide a full refund and cannot refuse to do so. Do I need to escalate this further?
1703069776 Seller: Unfortunately legally this is only the case for faulty items. As your item was not faulty, we cannot provide a full return. As mentioned, we would be happy to provide an exchange. Given that you plan to re-purchase an item from our shop, this would act in the same way as receiving a full return and buying from our shop again. 
1703069861 Buyer: ok on the basis that the value is to the full I will treat it as a refund. I will need you to retract your review of me though as it is offensive and defamatory
1703070042 Seller: Yes, we will be able to give you an exchange of the same amount you bought. I will put a note in the system for you. Regarding the review, this was a response to your offensive and unfair review of the shop. We have a near-spotless reputation which was rightfully and fairly earned and do not want to unfairly tarnish this reputation. As your issue has now been resolved and I have put a note in the system for you to have an exchange of the full amount, please could your review be retracted.
1703070179 Buyer: My review was an honest response to your less than savoury tactics, I have the evidence to back up my review and what has occured. That I am now willing to move on from it doesn't change what has happened, I want the review you left removing and an apology issued in return for agreeing to your exchange proposal. At present your actions leave you on thin ground legally.
1703070246 Seller: As your response was an initial response prior to this conversation where your issue has been successfully resolved, we would like for you to apologise and retract the bad review. 
1703070374 Buyer: I will provide a follow up review praising this interaction but I am unwilling to apologise or change the intitial review as it was an honest appraisal of the situation at the time. You owe me a full and frank apology for your comments and conduct. Have you not heard the expression, the customer is always right?
1703070467 Seller: Yes, please can you provide an updated review to retract the initial bad review. I have apologised several times during our conversation. Given the hostility from you, we would also respect an apology in response. Thank you.
1703070568 Buyer: I will not be issuing an apology, if you want me to provide the secondary review it will require your retraction of your personal attack on me and an apology otherwise we can both walk away from this and I will pursue the matter through the courts.
1703070686 Seller: We are happy for you to retract the initial bad review, thank you for your efforts on this. We are happy to also retract any personal attacks in our review response, keeping the explanation for what happened so that potential future buyers have a good understand of what happened. This is vital for our fair and earned reputation.

1703070862 Seller: Unfortunately this was not what we discussed. We agreed on an exchange which would work in a similar way to getting a refund. I.e., we will give you the same value back so that you can re-purchase an item from our shop. 
1703070889 Buyer: in that instance I would consider it a full refund
1703070923 Seller: Legally, this is not considered a full refund. Please accept the initial deal made and I hope you have a good rest of your day.
1703071015 Buyer: if you will not consider it a full refund then we are back to square one unfortunately, I cannot continue this negotiation when you continue to act in bad faith
1703071106 Seller: Unfortunately, as a shop we are required to follow the law. Legally, unless the item is faulty we cannot issue a full refund. As you agreed earlier, we can issue an exchange which enables you do perform the same actions you want (to re-purchase an item from our shop) in a way that abides by both the law and shop policy. 
1703071246 Buyer: you are already breaking the law by trying to refuse the return, for convenience I have agreed to the exchange but I do consider that to be a full refund. Unfortunately as you continue to lie and obfuscate this issue I will need to walk away and pursue this through the courts unless you agee to consider it a full refund, you retract your bad review and I will retract mine. If this is not agreed then I will walk away.
1703071324 Seller: You are fine to agree for this to be considered personally as a refund, however we cannot legally label is as such. We are happy with the rest of the agreements made. Thank you for your cooperation.

1703070054 Seller: Please can you reconsider this as we have accepted to refund your item outside of our refund policy and offer a full refund. Please consider that negative reviews can have a huge impact on small businesses. We will have to address the bad review with a full description of what we offered so that potential  new customers can see we are a fair and transparent business.

I understand the impact this has on small business owners, yet I did not recieve the item as specified on your website and on the order email. For the time being my review will stand. Once the item is returned and the funds are transferred back to my account, I will edit my review.
1703070508 Seller: Please note that writing false reviews is unfair to businesses, and we can and will take this further with our legal team. Please note deformation against a company is a serious matter and writing untrue statements is libel.

Until then we will answer your false review with a true account of what has happened and screenshots of the order with retracted personal information.

Since I did not recieve the specified item my review will stand. Once our business is concluded I am more than happy to edit my review as long as you edit your review about my account.

1703069538 Seller: Hello and thanks for contacting me. I'm sorry you haven't experienced what you were hoping for. However, I must point out that the shirt being sold was not for a specific player and this was made clear at the point of purchase.
1703069596 Buyer: When I placed the order the shirt was for the specific player.  My nephew is terminally ill and he is a devoted fan of Kobie which is specifically why I ordered the shirt
1703069669 Seller: I'm afraid the website clearly lists the shirts as being non-specific to a player, therefore, I have fulfilled by contractural obligation as a seller. I am sorry about this.
1703069774 Buyer: When I placed the order those terms were not in place.  I'm happy to reach a mutually agreeable resolution, my prime aim is to get the Kobie shirt for my little nephew
1703069906 Seller: These terms were in place and am happy to point these out to you again. I may be able to seek a replacement but the damaging review of my business would need to be reviewed. I am sorry for your personal difficulties and that this may have impinged on you seeing all the terms and specifics of the sale.

1703069393 Buyer: I will not remove my review because as you know you have also written a counter review about me. I think this is shocking given the fact you are the one that is giving the bad service, I simply wanted to warn other buyers incase they are scammed too. I received a shirt that did not have Kobe Bryant on but another random player I had never heard of. This is particularly upsetting as it is a gift for my terminally ill nephew.

1703072918 Buyer: Not at all, I really wouldn't lie about having a young family member who was going to die. I was hoping to appeal to your human nature but I see you are not open to understanding or negotiating. As such, I have put up a negative review of your item and you as a seller, in the hopes that no one else makes the same misunderstanding, especially as you are so unwilling to compromise and show compassion.
1703073062 Seller: I am not saying you lied but telling me i should refund you due to illness of a family member is trying to twist my arm and go down the sympathy route when i do not need to know this. It just seems like you are digging  a bigger hole in order to keep the item and get your money back. I have seen your feedback and do not agree with it and have also left my own for yourself, i see you have left other sellers similar feedback too which rings alarm bells once again!
1703073234 Buyer: That is not what I'm saying, I apology for the misunderstanding. Your original advert was misleading and unclear, made quite evident by the fact you have since changed it. I can see other reviews that also corroborate this. Telling you about my nephew was trying to get you to understand the importance as I don't have unlimited time or funds to sort this for my nephew. I thought you may be more understanding and compassionate given the situation but obviously one transaction is more important to you than your reputation or customer satisfaction? I've never left an unfair review, your negative feedback for me is unfounded as I have paid you money for an item you have misrepresented and done nothing wrong. Everything I have stated is the truth. What can we do to resolve this?

1703090618 Seller: Seeing as the descriptions on my site are already accurate, I can not agree to these terms. If you had a screenshot or proof that the description was incorrect, I would consider reviewing that, but if not, then I will not claim responsibility for this.

It did not match the description and is not what i want.
1703091130 Seller: We apologize for any misunderstandings - what specifically was the problem with the product?
1703091194 Buyer: When I ordered the jersey it was supposed to be a Kobe  replica Jersey. The person i was buying for is a huge Kobe fan. The jersey I received was an LA Lakers jersey but not Kobe.
1703091281 Seller: Unfortunately the product does not specify a specific player - the expectation of a Kobe jersey does not reflect the products description. We understand your frustrations, so we can issue a 25% coupon to be used on a future order; however we cannot issue a full refund for this item
1703091411 Buyer: When i purchased the item it was specific, the ad has clearly been changed since then. This is not how i expect a seller to conduct themselves. I do not think a coupon for a future item is an acceptable compromise.
1703091519 Seller: The ad has remained the same since it's listing. Unfortunately due to policy we cannot issue a full refund on this item; the coupon code is the best we can do. If you'd like to proceed we can issue this via email in the next 24hrs.
1703091630 Buyer: If that is your company policy  i feel that other people should know about that before purchasing items from you. If you are unable to refund me for the wrong item, I will have to leave a negative review.
1703091706 Seller: As is your right, however we will also have to provide a buyer review to notify other sellers of the potential risks associated with your account (false claims, demands for refunds). Please let us know if there is anything else we can help with in the future. Thanks
1703091811 Buyer: We can both avoid going this way. 25% is not a large enough coupon in my opinion. Can we agree on better compensation?
1703091865 Seller: We could increase the coupon to a 75% coupon, on an order of $50 or more
1703091941 Buyer: I will agree to that. Is there any chance on my next order I can write a note indicating the specific jersey I would like? That way I get exactly the right item, and you have made 2 sales.

1703091551 Seller: I have records of website modifications and can prove that the item description was not modified after your date of purchase. In addition I have looked at your review history and this is not the first time you have tried to get an unjust refund. I will not be issuing any refund and leaving you a bad review to warn other sellers. I have over 1000 5-star reviews and yours is clearly an outlier, nice try.
1703091674 Buyer: I would like you to price it to me please. Moreover I will go ahead and call my bank to raise a dispute so they will deal with it and I will not take back my review and rather spread it to the knowledge of other customers via google as well. I will do my best to inform other customers and warn them not to do business with you. 
1703091851 Seller: I am not worried. My positive reviews will largely outweigh your one negative one. This was an error on your part for not reading the desciption of the item and then attempting to lie about it to get a refund. We will under no circumstances be issuing a refund as we are not in the wrong. In addition, I will be contacting our website manager and make sure an inquiry is opened against your account which could result in a permanent ban.
1703091919 Buyer: Please go ahead and submit and I will wait for the proofs you have. This was a gift for someone very dear to me , it is time for holidays, have some decency and stop lying , I know what I ordered. This is literally the first time I am running into such a seller who is a cheat. I am walking away with no deal , negative review stays and will spread more. No apologies. I will call bank, I heard they stop doing business with such sellers, so yeah. Good luck
1703091974 Seller: But it isn't the first time as I have evidence in your reviews that you have attempted this scam before. Another lie. Nice try. Go ahead and call your bank for a refund as you will not be getting one from us.

1703091724 Buyer: You changed the item description on the website. I have a screenshot of the old description. If you do not provide me with a refund I will be submitting a complaint to EBay and also filing for a credit card dispute.
1703091839 Seller: that is patently untrue. I have seen you have negative reviews from other sellers. I can now understand why. I am going to post a negative review about you if we can't come to an agreement and you acknowledge that the product was as described
1703091919 Buyer: Maybe you are looking at the wrong buyer because I have all positive reviews on my profile. Anyways, I did not receive the correct product which is unfair and I should be receiving a refund for this.
1703091999 Seller: It seems we are involved in a major miscommunication here. I really don't want to spend time arguing with you about this. To resolve this issue I can offer you the option of an exchange for a different product but not a refund
1703092193 Buyer: Alternatively, I would be much more comftrable with a partial refund, I will return the item and we can both retract our reviews. I will purchase the jersey elsewhere this jersey was not for myself but for my nephew who has cancer so it is utmost importance for them to have a Kobe jersey. I am hoping we can come to an agreement soon.
1703092327 Seller: Oh gosh, I am so sorry to hear about your nephew. I understand why this ordeal is so upsetting for you. While there has been a clear miscommunication between us and I don't feel this necessitates a partial refund, I will relent because I take pity on you given your circumstances and I am super busy with holiday orders.

1703091725 Buyer: The website clearly stated it was a Kobe Bryant jersey and I paid $75 dollars for this. But, I received a DIFFERENT player’s Lakers jersey. I am requesting a refund for this as a result of your false advertising.
1703091844 Seller: unfortunately they were not stated to be specific players and it was a generic jersey, but i can understand your frustrations. i would like to solve this; i cannot provide a full refund but would a partial refund be sufficient if the bad reviews were taken down? 
1703091988 Buyer: I want a full refund. You deceptively changed the description of the product to a generic Lakers jersey, so I know you are lying. I have the screenshots to prove it.
1703092139 Seller: The description was not changed, no other customers have experienced this issue as it is very clear what you are receiving. I cannot provide you with a full refund at this time. How else can we compromise on this situation to resolve it?
1703092250 Buyer: The description was changed. You’re clearly still lying to my face. I have a spotless reputation on this website and have made dozens of transactions. This is the first time I have ever experienced such awful customer service. I will send the jersey back to you in the mail, but I want a full refund. I see in your review, you called me a smartass, slanderer, and fraud. I think potential buyers will already be put off by this attitude. No need to take the review down. I have posted a bad review of you too and will add my receipts for credibility and warn other potential buyers. However, I may consider taking it down if you provide me a full refund.

1703092844 Seller: Hi, That would not be a problem, taking down the review is very important as you will be getting your refund once i confirm the product doesn't match the initially advertised one
1703093011 Buyer: Thank you! I'm more than happy to remove the review if things are made right. I felt highly disappointed as this jersey was supposed to be a gift for my terminally ill nephew. It was clearly advertised as a kobe bryant jersey and I can't give him a random jersey as it won't bring him happiness in these final moments. This had a huge negative impact and while my review was harsh, it was because this has caused me and my nephew great distress. 
1703093231 Seller: I'm sorry for any inconveniences I might have caused, I would be happy to make a refund once the product is been sent to the store for confirmation. please do well to have the item sent back so we can confirm and start the refund process immediately
1703093340 Buyer: Thank you, I apologize for any harsh words I might have had in my initial review, but this was mainly because of the great distress this situation had upon me. I'm more then happy to sent it back as well as update your review to a positive one. It would mean a lot to me for you to apologize and update my review as well.
1703093506 Seller:  I definitely would do that immediately. I hope you understand why I gave the negative review was me trying to protect the reputation of my business. i felt attacked

I recently received an incorrect item, as well as a poor review from you, when you had an incorrect listing and failed to provide what I paid for. At the very least, I would like a refund, so I can get the correct item, as it's for a very important cause. I would also like to have you correct your rating that left you on my account, as it doesn't represent the truth, and is inappropriate for you to have sent.
1703092632 Seller: Hello, we apologize for the inconvenience. However, as stated in our policies, all sales are final therefore are unable to accomodate a refund. The listing was listed as a replica jersey without a specific player number as said in the description. What we can do is offer you a 10$ store credit or an item exchange if you are interested, then we can tlak about the bad ratings we both received 
1703092812 Buyer: If the listing were correct to begin with, the sale being final would not have been a problem, however, due to your false advertising that you corrected and tried to hide, I was tricked into purchasing something I did not want, through no fault of my own. I understand that policies exist to make things go smoothly, but exceptions must be made when there is a fair reason for doing so. If I had purchased the wrong item willingly, then I would accept my mistake, and would never have left negative feedback. I only expect the same reasonableness from you, in return.
1703092986 Seller: I understand, but if you go to the listing it will state ""the jersey is not for a specific player"", therefore it is not an incorrect listing. When you made the purchased you agreed to our terms of all sales being final. Therefore the best that can be offered is a 10$ store credit or an item exchange. 
1703093207 Buyer: When I made the purchase, the listing was incorrect. Although it has now been corrected, that doesn't help me retroactively. The current state of the listing is irrelevant, although I appreciate you correcting it for future buyers, so they won't be mislead as I was. My only goal is to get a full refund, so I can purchase the correct jersey from somewhere else. If you would like this jersey back, I will gladly return it, because I have no need for it, since it isn't what I paid for. I appreciate that you're likely told to give only a credit, but to be perfectly honest, no, you don't actually understand.
1703093371 Seller: The listing has not been changed since it was made. If you would like to proceed with a store credit or exhange for another item we can, but no refund is allowed accordign to our policies
1703093612 Buyer: Here's the deal. If you will provide me with the correct item, I will gladly exchange the incorrect item I received, and consider the exchange as the equivalent of a refund, since that's all I really want. I will then gladly change my negative review to a positive one, to reflect your reasonableness, and honesty, and I would fairly expect you to do the same. However, if all you want to do is lie to me, and try to hold your ground on your policies, I have absolutely no respect left for you, and will leave my negative feedback, to warn others of your deception and unreasonableness. This purchase is for a child that likely will not live long enough to receive another option, but if I can get a refund or an exchange, at least I can try my best to get it to him in time. I don't know what this jersey is worth to you, but it's worth the world to him.
1703093901 Seller: Since our jerseys do not have specific player numbers, we can't offer a kobe bryant jersey but we can exchange it for sweater that has kobe on it if that works for you. It looks very similar but is as a sweater. If you change my review to a positive one i will do the same for you. I apolgize for our information on our website not being clear for our customers, and will make sure this is not a future problem by making it in clearer writing about the specifics of the jersey. 
1703093997 Buyer: I would absolutely appreciate that exchange, as he is a big Kobe fan, and despite it not being a jersey, he would be thrilled to have it. And I greatly appreciate you clarifying the listings and working with me on this. I will be sure to update the review accordingly. I apologize for any misunderstandings, and I once again thank you for your reasonableness and patience.
1703094110 Seller: Ok the exhange details will be sent in an email. I hope he likes the sweater! Im sorry for the confusion and wish you the best.

I have checked some inventory and I have copies of a signed Kobe photograph.  As a goodwill gesture, I will send one to you upon an update of your review.

1703094287 Seller: I'm sorry you aren't satisfied but we have a no refund policy and I believe the product was exactly as advertised.
1703094333 Buyer: I have a screenshot of the original ad stating this was a Kobe Bryant jersey, and also a photo of the jersey that arrived. I believe you are mistaken and would appreciate a refund. I would rather end it here and not escalate further.
1703094509 Seller: It clearly states on our website that we cannot guarantee any particular jersey. I do not wish for this to escalate either, perhaps we could simply retract the negative reviews on each other and move along. Again, my apologies if you were made to believe you were going to receive a specific shirt.
1703094570 Buyer: I would be glad to retract the negative reviews, but I really do need a refund. This jersey is going to my young nephew, who has a terminal illness, and I do not have funds for a different jersey. 
1703094663 Seller: I'm sorry, we have a strict no refund policy. I'm sorry to hear of your nephew's illness. I wish him the best. 
1703094725 Buyer: Is there another way we can come to agreement that satisfies both our needs? Do you have a Kobe Bryant jersey in stock that you could send in return for me returning this item? I would consider that equivalent to a refund even though it may technically not count as one under your policy.
1703094771 Seller: I would certainly be willing to do that.
1703094808 Buyer: Thank you! I will do that and we will both retract our reviews, and I think it works all around. I appreciate your effort.

1703096138 Buyer: I can assure you that your prices are not competitive. The only reason I placed an order with you was that you promised next day delivery.

The description said it woudl be a Kobe Bryant jersey, but this is not what I recieved. 
1703095263 Seller: I'm so sorry that you were disappointed in your purchase. As the website states, you will not be assured to get the player of your choice, I'm afraid that I can't make an exchange for you.
1703095322 Buyer: I have a screenshot of the original product description, which specifically says that this is a Kobe Bryant jersey. If the product description has been changed since then, it is not my problem. I want a refund for this misleading product.
1703095439 Seller: I'm afraid you're mistaken. The Kobe Bryant was shown as an example. The website clearly states that your player cannot be ordered. But I would like to come to some resolution here. I could offer you a partial refund, if we could resolve the issue of your negative review on my site.
1703095536 Buyer: I want a full refund, because I purchased the jersey for my terminally ill nephew (who is a Kobe Bryant fan). Since your product was inaccurate, I will need to purchase the correct item elsewhere instead. I will not consider changing the review unless I can recieve a full refund.
1703095711 Seller: I'm so sorry to hear about your nephew. I completely understand. I can offer a full refund, if you agree to buy the jersey you want from us. I will personally work with our supplier to assure that you will get what you want. But you will need to write an apology for that negative review, telling how I was able to resolve your problem in a postive way.
1703095977 Buyer: That is unacceptable. I do not intend to do any further business with your company, because you have already betrayed my trust once with your misleading product description and denial of responsibility. You have also falsely accused me of being fraudulent, when it is you who went back to change the product description to avoid admitting to your own mistakes - even when I have offered screenshot evidence of the original product description. If you do not agree to give me a full refund for this, I will walk away and keep the bad review. 
1703096032 Seller: I'm sorry then. We cannot come to a resolution. 
1703096106 Buyer: I'm sorry to hear that your lucrative business dealings are worth more than the integrity of your character, and the happiness of a terminally ill child. 
1703096218 Seller: I wish your nephew well. However, since you can't be reasonable for his sake, we will have to walk away. I did offer you a full refund and personally promised to make sure the next order was what you wanted. But since that was not good enough for you, then I hope you find the jersey you are looking for at another store. Good luck.
1703096327 Buyer: That is not a sincere offer. If you really did have a sense of responsibility, you would offer the full refund without demanding anything in return, and accept the fact that your company messed up the original order. I said that I was open to changing my review after that condition was fulfilled, but you could not regain my trust without attaching lucrative strings to the deal. As such, you have failed this negotiation process.

1703096361 Seller: It most certainly is not our intention to deceive customers, but our website clearly describes the item you purchased. I am not sure where the confusion is coming from. We appreciate you being a costumer and wish your nephew well

I am a regular customer with your company and this is the first time I have run into an issue like this. I would like to continue doing business with you if you will make this purchase beneficial to me. At this time I have just purchased a $75 wash rag for my dishes. Please meet me in the middle and assist me in getting this corrected. I will even pay for the return shipping to get the correct jersey I need.
1703096715 Seller: It is hard for me to believe that you are a supportive customer after you left the egregious review of my business. Not to mention the other, awfully similar, reviews you have left of other businesses. How can I be sure you mean well when that review is still up?
1703096897 Buyer: I admit, I may have posted some ugly items about this transaction being the heat of the moment. I have been trying for several days now to get this corrected with your company and noone wants to assist. So if this how you conduct business my reviews may be rude, but was it a lie? If you were to right by me I would certainly do right and update the post of how your business correct this ""misunderstanding"". 
1703097017 Seller: I had no choice but to write my own review of you to warn other businesses of your scheme. I am sure it will be difficult to get your holiday shopping done when no one wants to do business with you. Perhaps we can both agree to remove our respective reviews and handle this like adults.

1703097515 Seller: I do not sell the player jersey that you are looking for. Which is why I am confused as to how you read that on the listing. The only jersey for the team you are wanting is the generic championship jersey that you purchased. 
1703097724 Buyer: You had the photo of that particular player on your site. This is how you got my business in the first place. Why would I just request any random player for that amount of money? This makes no sense. You know what....I will keep the shirt and I will keep my review about you as well. Unlike you I can change my screenname and you review will not follow me. I don't understand how you will be giving me special treatment when you did false advertising in the first place.

The jersey I received isn't the one that was listed and I wouldn't have spent money if I had known this is what I was going to be sent
1703096366 Seller: Hi, the jersey was received as listed on the website. The website clearly states that there is no player specified for the jersey. 
1703096456 Buyer: It didn't say that at the time I purchased it. At that time, it specifically mentioned the jersey being Kobe Bryant's. The listing was edited afterwards to 'no player specified for the jersey'. 
1703096520 Seller: Sorry, but the website never listed it as specifically a Kobe Bryant jersey. 
1703096693 Buyer: The jersey was meant for a sick family member who loves Kobe Bryant. I would not have bought any other jersey for that reason. Please make this right and give me a refund so I can get my sick family member the jersey he wanted. I have no idea how I'll break it to him that I wasn't able to get him his only wish if not
1703096770 Seller: Sorry, but that personal situation has nothing to do with our transaction. You purchased a general jersey, and that's what was received. I won't give a refund for that. 
1703096924 Buyer: If you won't refund me, which you would if you had any kind of decency at all, you should at least take down the negative review about me and apologize for this extremely unpleasant situation.
1703097010 Seller: With that attitude, sorry I don't think we can come to any conclusion. Other stores should be warned about this completely unacceptable behavior from you. You even tried to guilt trip with a sick relative due to the fact you didn't properly read the listing.
1703097264 Buyer: Ah, so you want to be the tough guy fraudster. Well, I guess I'll open up a case against you in small claims. I will find the old listing you had up at the time I purchased the jersey stating that it was specifically Kobe Bryant's through archived pages, show proof that the time I purchased was the same time as that listing was up, and have you pay not only my refund but court costs as well. I'll also sue you for slander and forcibly have the review taken down if you want to play this game. You are committing fraud by the form of false advertisement and you will lose in court. It would save alot of time and hassle just to get it over with now.

1703096713 Seller: My business is ethical and has always been fairly run. I also have the description of the item on the website. I will refute what you post and also keep the review of you as a Buyer to indicate to others your unethical behaviour if you do not retract your review as well.
1703096842 Buyer: My screenshot clearly shows you altered the page to remove the description.  I can also report you to the Best Business Bureau which will put a permanent negative mark on your business.
1703096929 Seller: I did not alter the page and have a history of my webpage to prove it. I can also report you and have been contacted by another Seller where you have tried to do these same dirty tactics.
1703096999 Buyer: Please do that.  I would love for you to post more lies so I can show how corrupt you are.
1703097030 Seller: I am not sure what your end goal is here, because I have not changed anything on the website. Either you are trying to defraud me, or you have made a mistake.
1703097104 Buyer: There has been no mistake.  If you are ethical company, you would provide a refund for sending an item I clearly do not want.  Your behavior in this matter will be a warning that no one should buy anything from you.

1703096710 Buyer: But you have changed your ad since then. So that is unhelpful to me. 
1703096771 Seller: The ad is the same one as I have had multiple of the same jerseys for sale. I see that another seller has posted an incident such as this with you. I think this is something you do to get money and free items.

The jersey was advertised as being a Kobe Bryant jersey. The jersey I received was not of Kobe Bryant. I am looking to obtain a refund as the item was not delivered as described at the time of purchase. I also would like to see an apology for your negative review that was posted about me after I made a review explaining my negative experience due to this incident. If this can happen, I will change my negative review of you as a seller.
1703096767 Seller: Hi. While I certainly apologize for any misunderstanding, the item you purchased was clearly marked as a generic Lakers jersey. It was not marketed as a Kobe Bryant jersey. If you look at the description of the item both on my site and on your receipt of purchase, you will see this. It also indicates that all purchases are final and no refunds are available. While I am sorry you are not happy with your purchase, I cannot refund money (as this will cost me money) for a mistake I didn't make. I would be willing to consider removing my negative review of you if you remove your negative review of me.
1703096957 Buyer: Unfortunately for you this will not be happening. I purchased the item under the impression (based on the description on YOUR product page) that is was a Kobe Bryant jersey. At the time of purchase, this is what the description stated. Until this matter is resolved, my review of you as a seller is entirely justifiable and will remain. I do not want to see this same situation happen to anyone else who may be misled due to your deceptive marketing practices. With that said, I would love to see this resolved, but for that to happen it will require you to own up to the fact that you used deceptive marketing by making things right.
1703097155 Seller: Unfortunately for you, I did not use deceptive marketing practices. My description of the item has never been changed. (This can be verified by the site analytics.) I also am aware you have tried this fraudulent behavior with other sellers. We can resolve this amicably or I can report you to the site for removal. 
1703097286 Buyer: Site analytics prove nothing in this instance. Traffic counts have zero relation to page details. I would happily take this up with the site as I am in no way in the wrong here. If you do choose this route, I can almost guarantee that you will be at high risk for removal. I would much rather see this resolved now for your sake. If you would like to save yourself the potential consequences of abusing the reporting system, I would be happy to settle this now.
1703097544 Seller: Actually, the site analytics for this site do show all changes to descriptions. They are timestamped with the date and time of the change and previous descriptions are cached so that they can be viewed by the site managers. These will show the description was never changed. Again, the description is clearly shown on your receipt as well. You have lodged similar complaints against other sellers as well which shows your pattern of behavior in trying to get refunds for items in the same manner. I can assure you that you will be removed from the site if I make an additional complaint against you. I am not worried about any complaint you make as I have the facts and evidence to back up that I sent you the jersey you ordered. You are free to make any complaint you want but I will not issue a refund and I will not at this time take down my review of you. You can choose to accept this or I can report you for removal of the site.
1703097638 Buyer: No such instances have occurred at the rate you are describing. I find it appalling that you would make such a claim. With that said, your job as a seller is to respond to customer issues and to seek resolutions...
1703097758 Seller: My job as a seller is to send items that customers ordered. I have done this. My job as a seller is not to allow customers to seek resolutions that are not warranted. You will not receive a refund. I will not remove my review of you as a buyer. I have reported you to the site management. Have a nice day!
1703097858 Buyer: I am willing to return the product. I simply want to either receive the Kobe Bryant jersey that was ordered, or to have my money refunded... I am unsure of how much clearer I can make this.
1703097936 Seller: I do not sell a Kobe Bryant jersey. I do not take returns or issue refunds (all sales are final as listed on the description and your receipt). With that, our conversation is complete.
1703097995 Buyer: Misleading customers is not a smart business method. Are you an actual human or are you merely an AI? I have made my concern clearly and I feel as though you are either ignoring what I'm saying or simply don't care.

Everything on the listing was honest and straightforward. I placed the negative review for you as a buyer due to these accusations, the negative review, and the fact that this doesn't seem to be the first time this has happened. I would be willing to take down the negative review of you if you were willing to do the same for my brand. This is my livelihood and I feel it was undeserved, due to what I've stated above.

You are out of your mind if you think that I'm going to take down my negative review of you so you can do that for me. I'll be posting a transcript of this discussion all over discussion boards and facebook and tagging your company. Then I'll be going to the BBB and naming you specifically in a case that I'll be bring against your company. Do you own this company? Are you willing to go to court for them and have YOUR name smerred around the internet or are you making minimum wage while someone else is getting all the cash.

Respectfully, I am hoping to resolve this issue. I would first like to request a refund as the item I received is not what I paid for. It is going to be a gift for someone who is ill. I am asking you to do the right thing. Sellers and businesses can write off losses on their taxes. Everyone makes mistakes, and I simply just want what I paid for. Thank you.
1703096893 Seller: The item that you bought was not for a specific player.  Is there anything damaged with the item or is it the wrong size?
1703097026 Buyer: At the time of purchase, it was specified that it would be for Kobe. I paid close attention to ensure I would purchase the right item. I understand if your product listing has now changed, for all future buyers. However, at the time I purchased it, it specified that it would be a Kobe jersey. Aside from not getting what I received, there is no damage or other issues. I am happy to return the product if provided with a return label. I just want to receive what I paid for. Additionally, I would like to work with you and hopefully have the negative review of me removed. In turn I am offering to remove the negative review I wrote for you. I think this is fair, as the reviews only harm both of us.
1703097177 Seller: If you check the listing closely it states that it is not for a specific player.  Kobe Jerseys are at a premium price and would not be available at that price point.  I have no problem refunding you the purchase price of the jersey if you are not satisfied but the negative review is not appropriate I feel as I shipped you what was advertised. 
1703097284 Buyer: Hello, thank you. Yes, please refund the jersey, I am happy with that resolution. I am confident that I did order one that was for Kobe, and perhaps there was a glitch with the website which is neither of our fault(s). Thank you for offering to refund. Would you also like to remove the negative reviews of each other? (There reviews do not benefit either of us.)
1703097345 Seller: That seems like a good idea and a fair r3esolution for us both.
1703097363 Buyer: Alright, sounds like a plan,

1703097175 Buyer: You advertised it as a Kobe Bryant Lakers Jersey. You changed the ad after I made the purchase. If you can replace this Jersey with the Kobe Bryant Jersey that I originally ordered, I can return this Jersey for the correct one. I hope to do this quickly as it is a gift for my nephew who has cancer and is receiving treatments.
1703097253 Seller: A Kobe Bryant jersey would be 3x the price. That is not what I advertised. If you can show me a screen shot of what you thought you saw, that would be find. I usually do not offer refunds, but I'm offering one to you if you return the unwanted item that you accidently purchased.
1703097378 Buyer: You are using deceptive advertising and I fell for it. I didn't take a screen shot as I didn't think I was buying from a dishonest seller. I will return the Jersey and expect a full refund for what I paid. Thanks for cheating someone who was trying to cheer up a 10 year old child undergoing cancer treatment. You should be ashamed.
1703097505 Seller: I look forward to receiving your return. As soon as it is received, you will get a complete refund. If you need the jersey for your ill nephew, I can send one to you for delivery tomorrow as soon as I receive payment for it. I do not mind shipping this overnight so you can fulfill your nephew's ddream of having the jersey.

1703097178 Seller: That's some strong language. I absolutely did not alter the listing in any way after sending you the item and I can prove it through my webhost. I'm sorry you feel the way you do but there was no fraud, the correct item was sent and all sales are unfortunately final.
1703097258 Buyer: The item I received was definitely not what I purchased.  I would not have purchased this, and I do not want it.  I'm happy to return it, but I want a refund because I did not receive what I ordered.

1703097449 Buyer: I know what the listing said at the time I purchased the item.  I will certainly be leaving my review up in order to warn others so that they don't make the mistake of purchasing from you as well.
1703097580 Seller: I'm sorry you feel that way. I will have to leave my review of you up as well as you've made an error as well as provided insulting language such as ""defraud"" which is grounds for slander should I choose to pursue it. On your end, you should be concerned about your continued use of the platform if I can prove through the metadata that the information was never altered and that the correct item was sent. This could result in a ban for you. At minimum, I would like an apology for the strong and inaccurate language. Ideally I would also like you to retract your review. If you would agree to do so, I will retract my review of you as well.
1703097753 Buyer: I will definitely not apologize or retract my review, since you are completely unwilling to refund me.  I have a good reputation on this site with other sellers, and you are the only person I have had a problem with, so your threats of getting me banned do not worry me.  You on the other hand have written libelous statements about me in your review, so if I were you I would not be so quick to make those threats.
1703097894 Seller: It's not a threat but a concern for you. I am unwilling to refund you, I'm guessing by your strong and confrontational language that you do not have a good reputation (you've previously done this with another seller) and nothing I've stated has approached libel, I've merely stated you received the correct item from the listing. But it appears you are content to be hostile to me so I will offer one last deal: you retract your review, I will retract mine, and we'll go our separate ways. I cannot provide you with a refund because you did indeed receive the correct item.

However, if you are willing to cooperate with me, I would be happy to leave you a good review explaining the excellent customer service I received.

1703097502 Seller: You purchased a Jersey and are unhappy with the fact that even though it was stated on the website to be a specific player, that it what you expected.
1703097564 Buyer: Ah yes, so I believe I should at least get a refund for that,no?
1703097616 Seller: I’m not giving a refund because of what was stated on the website.
1703097664 Buyer: But the website stated a specific player and then removed that statement after I complained
1703097700 Seller: No, it did not. It was not for a specific player. You thought it was.
1703097747 Buyer: Why not state specifically that it would not be a specific player, is that not a bit decietful
1703097840 Seller: That is exactly what it said. So there was no deceit involved, you just misread, it happens. I would like you to remove the bad review because it tarnished my pristine rating, and unrightfully so.
1703097898 Buyer: Can I at least get a partial refund here
1703097939 Seller: I’m sorry, no. It is clearly stated in the Terms and Conditions of purchase that there is No refunds.

1703097248 Buyer: At the time of my purchase, the item was listed specifically as a Kobe Bryant jersey.  This was important as the intended recipient has a special love for that particular player.  
1703097300 Seller: There was never a mention of that.  I can provide the ad for you to review.  It was listed as a replica of a jersey.  No names were ever mentioned.

1703097398 Seller: it is not against the law to refuse returns, particularly when the published policy is that all sales are final
1703097498 Buyer: Your published policy does not supersede consumer law.
1703097680 Seller: the law does not provide for unconditional returns. we can keep discussing this; however, you stated at the outset that you were will to resolve this in a mutually agreeable way. to that end, while the product was shipped as advertised, we can , if you are amenable, set up a return with a restocking fee

1703097488 Buyer: I would consider retracting my review however I did not get what I paid for and would not have purchased the jersey had I known it wasn't for Kobe Bryant. My nephew doesn't want a generic jersey.
1703097578 Seller: Our website says the jersey is not for a specific player. We were not offering a Kobe Bryant jersey.

1703113805 Seller: The best course of action for both parties is not to publish a negative review. If you choose to do so, we will be forced to make a negative review of you as a buyer, due to not following the guidelines stated in the website when you went through the process of buying the item.

I won't remove the negative review either way since this is a loss of my time.
1703113391 Seller: I understand that there has been some confusion regarding the purchase of the jersey but our our website clearly specifies the details of each product we sell. We take pride in being transparent and accurate in our product descriptions to ensure our customers know exactly what they are purchasing. Regarding our return policy, as stated on our website, all sales are considered final. This policy is in place to ensure fairness and clarity for all our transactions. I'm genuinely disheartened to hear that you feel this way but it is really important for us you withdraw your review  to rectify the misrepresentation of my business and protect my reputation. Could you consider  removing your negative review?
1703113632 Buyer: I won't be removing my negative review because, as I have previously stated, I was expecting a Kobe Bryant jersey, as your listing used to show before you knowingly changed to just a Lakers jersey. I have no need for a Lakers jersey, and I'll return the item if you give me my full refund. And I stand by my decision to keep my negative review as I wouldn't want any other buyer to fall for any potential scam in the future.
1703113841 Seller: I assure you that the integrity of our product listings is of utmost importance to us. Our website has consistently stated that the jersey in question is a Los Angeles Lakers team jersey, and not specifically a Kobe Bryant jersey. This has been the case since the item was listed, and there have been no alterations to the product description post-sale. I regret any misunderstanding this may have caused but can not offer you any refund as per our store's policy, all sales are final. This policy is crucial for the financial stability and integrity of my business, especially since the product was accurately described and delivered as promised.
1703114033 Buyer: It wasn't originally listed as a Lakers jersey, because if that was the case I wouldn't have any use for it. It was for a terminally ill familiar who's a big fan of Kobe Bryant, why would I buy a generic Lakers jersey if it wasn't something that interests him? I won't be removing the review unless I receive a satisfactory resolution for my case, thank you.
1703114183 Seller: I am genuinely sorry to hear about your family member's condition. I understand how important it is to find meaningful items for loved ones, especially under such circumstances. Given the special circumstances you've shared, I am willing to make an exception to our standard policy and propose a solution that could be beneficial for both of us. If you agree to return the jersey in its original condition, I am willing to discuss the possibility of a partial refund as a gesture of goodwill. In return, I would appreciate it if you could update your review to reflect this resolution.
1703114442 Buyer: Of course, I'm not against returning the item since I don't have any use for it. Package has only been opened to inspect the jersey so it only has been touched once. If this is okay, I'm willing to remove the negative review. Also, if you could remove the negative review for me when I remove the review from you that would be great too.
1703114599 Seller: I am glad to hear that. We will process your partial refund upon its receipt in original condition, package does not matter. Once this is settled, I will also remove my review, and appreciate your willingness to do the same.
1703114708 Buyer: Of course, thanks a lot for coming into terms with this. Have a great day, and as agreed, I'll begin the return process and then I'll remove the negative review accordingly. I'll keep you updated.
1703114798 Seller: Thank you for your cooperation; I look forward to receiving the returned jersey and finalizing our agreement. Additionally, I would appreciate an apology for the misunderstanding, as it will help in fully restoring our mutual respect and understanding.
1703114883 Buyer: I would agree to a public apology if you're also willing to issue one my way, that way we would be even. If not, I don't think it's necessary as it would be somewhat unfair here.
1703114978 Seller: I understand your perspective and agree to a mutual public apology to ensure fairness and close this matter on a positive note.
1703115104 Buyer: Then I think it's settled. I'll return the item, expect my partial refund, I'll remove the negative review and you'll remove mine, then we'll both apologize publicly to each other.

1703115298 Buyer: Well, I just want to clarify that when I made my purchase on your website, it specified that the jersey was of Kobe.

1703116966 Seller: I cannot give you a refund. If you want something else, I suggest you shop again or find other sellers. I will keep my review of you as a buyer because you have not provided any proof to dispute your claim.
1703117093 Buyer: there's nothing to argue about, forget about the jersey being a kobe bryant or not, I will return the product to you and you will give me my refund, that's how consumer rights work, don't they?
1703117201 Seller: You will not be receiving a refund. That's final.
1703117292 Buyer: then I will have to report you to the FTC for fraud, deception and consumer rights violations
1703117344 Seller: How can you report on something you don't have any proof on?
1703117421 Buyer: I have my receipt, that's my proof, oh and this conversation is also proof (I already took screenshots, don't worry)
1703117470 Seller: That's fine. I have all the proof to defend myself.
1703117671 Buyer: what proof, stop talking nonsense, you're just burying yourself deeper and deeper for your obvious fraud, you know what, I will just ask my bank to do a chargeback on the amount I spent on your jersey

1703115605 Seller: I'm sorry about your nephew. What I am authorized to do Is offer you a discount on another item of your liking. I am unable to issue refunds. but If you are willing to edit your review and offer an apology I can send you a discount code. Does that work for you?
1703115761 Buyer: I apologize if I said anything wrong the last time, and I am willing to edit my review and explain that I had better communication with you guys this time and apologize so I can get a discount code at least. It could work! I would also like an apology maybe from you guys because there was clearly a miscommunication issue. Does that work?

1703116095 Seller: in that case I will just summarize: We will offer no refund for your purchase. Remove our bad review and you will remove yours. Instead we both edit the reviews and apologize. Your discount code will be issued then. Thank you for your business!

1703116010 Buyer: If it was listed correctly, I would like you to prove to me you did not edit the post after I had already bought it. Your response to my review really shows how mature you are. I will keep this review up to prevent others from getting scammed like I was.
1703116166 Seller: I do not mean to call into question your definition of maturity and the irony of your response, but the website that i list my products on has not changed in a while, and if you require proof, you could check the invoice that was sent to you after the purchase was completed. If at that time it was incorrect, you could have easily cancelled the order before it was shipped.
1703116367 Buyer: Considering I have proof of the listing clearly stating it was a KOBE BRYANT jersey, including the invoice, of course I wasn't going to cancel this item that is super important to my nephew. This will only affect both of us if you continue to pretend you are not in the wrong. My reputation in this website is impeccable.
1703116565 Seller: You dont have proof though, i can see the invoice you recieved on my end. You will not be able to gaslight me in that way. Also you definitely do not have a good reputation on my website or any other, i have heard of you before from colleagues and you have done this kind of thing before. Whether is it due to gross negligence or malice, i will have to keep your negative buyer review up to warn other hard working sellers of your unprofessional and inappropriate behavior and or motives.
1703116696 Buyer: Oh but I do, not only being the invoice. There is this thing called smartphones which have cameras. If that's the game you want to play, we will see who is actually affected the most. And, my reputation in this website is perfect. 
1703116793 Seller: alright, at this point i cannot see this going anywhere productive. i dont see how a camera changes anything, as the invoice would not be affected by taking a photo of it.
1703116880 Buyer: The listing clearly showing KOBE BRYANT on it on my gallery would beg to differ. Have a good day.

1703116280 Buyer: IN YOUR AD YOU MENTIONED THAT IT WAS FROM THE LAKERS AND Kobe Bryant. When You Saw Your Mistake You Deleted Kobe Bryant's Part.
1703116422 Seller: I'm sorry that you feel that way, however, I have never had this problem with any customer before in my 10 years at this establishment. Additionally, I've been told by other store owners that they have had this same situation of you having problems with them many times before.
1703116613 Buyer: THERE ARE MANY DISHONEST SELLERS TODAY. I AM A PERSON WHO DOESN'T LET MYSELF BE FOOLED. THAT'S WHY I'M NOT LIKED. I WOULD KEEP THE TEE BUT IT'S NOT FOR ME. IT'S FOR MY SON AND KOBY IS HIS FAVORITE PLAYER.
1703116752 Seller: I understand that this shirt is for your son, and I respect that a lot. The best solution for this matter would be that I can offer you a full refund for the jersey because money does not mean a lot for me, and with that money you can use it to buy a new jersey someplace else. In exchange for the refund though, I just ask that you apologize and retract the hurtful negative review you left about me and my store so that we could both leave this situation a win-win.

1703116904 Seller: I'm sorry that you had this experience lately, lets see if we can try to come up with a solution. Now, it seems to be that you stated that the jersey was sold under false pretenses, however, on the store page it clearly states that the jerseys are not identified with players. There was no mention of any player name in the listing, so it is impossible for you to have received one with the wrong player name. I understand that this is frustrating for you and I am willing to compromise with a partial refund, however, I would like for you to remove your bad review as it does not properly gauge my business.
1703117166 Buyer: Thank you for your response. I would like to bring to your attention that when I originally purchased the jersey it specifically mentioned the players name that would be on the jersey. Since purchasing the item, I noticed that this was taken off from the ad listing. I'm willing to remove my bad review as you seem willing to help out with this situation and it seems like this mistake has been corrected, so it is unlikely to happen to other consumers. However, I still beleive a full refund would be the correct thing to do in this situation. I have no issues with returning the jersey in its original packaging so you will be able to resell it for the same value that you sold it me. 
1703117304 Seller: Unfortunately I would not be able to take the jersey back and resell it. You seem reasonable, so I'm also willing to remove the bad review that I placed on you, however, I cannot offer a full refund.

I would even cover the shipping costs if it meant that I got a full refund. Unfortunately, me removing my review that I left is contingent on you doing what is morally right in this situation as I don't want other consumers to have similar experiences that I have had with you. 
1703117736 Seller: Okay, how about I let you choose which course of action you will prefer: I am willing to provide a full refund if you pay for the shipping, however, I need to confirm that the product has not been opened or used in anyway. It has to be still sealed in the original packaging. Once this is confirmed, I will provide a refund. Or, I provide a partial refund and you can keep the jersey. Additionally, we both need to remove our bad reviews of each other.
1703117878 Buyer: I can agree to that. I will send you the photos of the jersey in its original jersey so that you can verify it, after which we can both agree to remove our bad reviews of each other. 
1703118024 Seller: Okay, after I received the jersey in the mail and check myself, I will send a full refund. If it is damaged or not in the packaging when I receive it, I will still provide a partial refund for your time. On the right side of the screen you can set the decisions for the finalization of the deal.

1703154733 Seller: As far as I'm aware, it was never promised so unfortunately I can't offer a refund
1703154778 Buyer: It was a gift for my terminal ill nephew, he is a big fan of Kobe, why would I buy something else? 
1703154844 Seller: I'm very sorry but there's nothing I can do, I'm willing to remove my bad review if you do the same
1703154869 Buyer: How about I remove my bad review and you give me a refund
1703154916 Seller: I'm sorry but a refund is not an option, I will apologise for the misunderstanding though

1703155108 Seller: I'm sorry but I can't offer a refund, we are confident that there was never any mention of a name of the shirt so there has been no mistake on our end
1703155208 Buyer: I am confident I purchased Kobe's shirt. You could at least give a partial refund as it was a gift to my terminal ill nephew who is a huge fan of Kobe.
1703155281 Seller: I didn't want to mention it but I've heard that this isn't the first time something like this has happened and this sounds like a plan to get a cheaper price. We will not be offering a refund
1703155358 Buyer: Well as you can see I only have good reviews and have purchased many items before, so this is not the case. If you give me a partial refund we both lose something. You dont have to apologize and I will and remove the bad review
1703155455 Seller: There has been no mistake on our end so an apology from us is already a compromise. I'm sure you can understand that giving a refund where no mistake has been made is bad for our business and our employees
1703155521 Buyer: As a business it is also important not to have bad reviews on your site so other people might change to another Seller. So I think this is a good compromise as I did not receive the product that was promised on your site
1703155638 Seller: Your bad review is based on false information, a name was never promised. If you want to keep the review then fine but we will be leaving our bad review up too. A refund is not negotiable and we don't need an apology from you

1703155908 Seller: A partial refund is not a compromise from you as no name was ever mentioned. A refund will not be happening. We will remove the bad review and apologise but no refund will be offered
1703156013 Buyer: Well then we are not getting anywhere. The jersey with the name was shown on the site. I have been screenshots so I am 100% right. So a partial refund is a very good compromise.

1703155087 Seller: Ok, as it is our error, I will send you the jersey free of charge, would you be happy to retract the negative review and we can both apologise?

Can I remind you that I have no oblgation to issue a refund as per my terms and conditions and so this is a very generous offer

1703155260 Seller: I believe you must be mistaken, we do not sell specific player jerseys. Are you able to send me a photo of the website ?
1703155357 Buyer: Unfortunately not, but as a trusted website and seller I believe you should and will honour the purchase I made, which was stated at the time and has since been changed.
1703155435 Seller: I am more than happy to honour purchases made where there is a genuine error on my behalf, however as we do not sell specific player jerseys I believe there has been some confusion
1703155522 Buyer: I think the confusion here is the fact your website stated I was buying a specific Jersey and has now subsequently changed which is not very honourable.

1703155910 Seller: As you mentioned previously I am a trusted seller with a very high reputation. This has never happened before as we don't sell or claim to sell specific player jerseys. Is there a possibility you have perhaps made a mistake? I am more than happy to try to help, if you read previous reviews you will see that other buyers have purchased the same jersey and have been happy with their order. Not one review mentions specific player jerseys
1703156011 Buyer: I would be happy with a refund, you can have the exact jersey you sent me and ill pay for the postage. It will be like we never did business at all.
1703156100 Seller: Unfortunately as stated upon time of purchase, when you ordered the non specific player jersey, we cannot offer refunds for customer errors
1703156164 Buyer: So how would you like to help as stated above?
1703156234 Seller: By pointing you in the direction of our previous reviews so you can reflect upon your purchase
1703156518 Buyer: Ok, I see where you stand and have tried to come to an agreement with you on this matter. You've not been very helpful on top of the deceitfulness and will just go ahead and warn others with a negative review on the terrible transaction and the shocking follow up customer service. My nephew who has been seriously ill is heartbroken about not receiving his Coby Bryant shirt and this will reflect in the review also.
1703156771 Seller: I disagree, I believe I have been more than helpful. Unfortunately, as I've mentioned previously I cannot financially justify refunds when they are due to customer error. If you are able to provide proof of ordering a specific player jersey, as you state - of course I would refund you, however I believe you may be mistaken and perhaps was looking at a different website. I am very sad to hear about your nephew and hope that you are able to find a Kobe bryant jersey elsewhere which he will be happy with. I have a good business relationship with a company who make jerseys such as these, and can ask for a discount on your nephew's behalf?

With regards to the negative review, I only ever post negative feedback when I have received unfair feedback as to the service I offer.

1703155627 Buyer: We differ in opinions about the issue of name or no name. Since we can't resolve that I would like to send to jersey back to you (the label is still on the shirt and I have the receipt) and get a refund for it. As good will I will pay for the shipping costs.
1703155792 Seller: I am sorry that the product is not what you are expected. Normally, it is a final sell but exceptionally I will accept a return with the shipping costs at your charge. Take a picture of the product before sending it to be sure that is a good standing to be sell again.

1703155959 Seller: I agree with your suggestions. As we have an agreement, we can both remove the review.
1703156045 Buyer: Thank your sir/madam. I will send the picture and the product to you and remove the review. May I receive a message when you received the product?

1703156411 Buyer: Thank you. Well, looking at my sceenshots from the original listing, the listing clearly stated that a Kobe Bryant shirt would be supplied, so it was falsely advertised. You have damaged my reputation as a buyer by falsely claiming I have been untruthful. This has caused me a large amount of distress when actually you were at fault here.

The item you sent was not what was outlined in the description at the time of buying. You have since changed this, and I hope you'd honour your original description and refund me in full for my item.
1703155094 Seller: Hi. I believe I made the description clear at the time of purchase and have not changed the description. I would offer a refund if I did change the description however I did no.
1703155190 Buyer: No, this was not clear. Do you have any evidence that the description was not changed? I'll happily remove my negative review of you in exchange for a full refund. You can't advertise an item and then change the description after sending the item - its unethical and cruel. All I would like is a refund so I can buy the correct Jersey, surely you don't want your shop reputation reflected poorly by my negative review?
1703155375 Seller: This was made clear that the jerseys that are sold are not specific to any player. I have many reviews from different customers that can prove that I do keep this description and would not change it as I value my customers and would not like to provide unsatisfactory services to them. As the item delivered was according to the description and arrived on time and in good condition I will not be giving a refund. I however advise that you remove the bad review as it is false.
1703155482 Buyer: Clearly we're not going to come to an agreement and you will not admit your fault. My negative review, as it is the most recent one, will likely encourage future buyers not to buy from you. People want specific jerseys hence ordering a specific one, no one wants to receive a random player they haven't heard of. To reiterate, I'll happily remove my review in exchange of a full refund. If you have regular buyers then surely this one refund won't impact your company profits too much.
1703155701 Seller: My store's policies and descriptions clearly state that any jerseys sold are not player specific and are just team specific. I apologize that perhaps this was misunderstood and  I would be willing to give you a full refund on the item you purchased if you sent the item back. I would also be willing to pay the delivery fee to have the item returned as it was not to your satisfaction.
1703155784 Buyer: As you've stated above, you ""value your customers and would not like to provide unsatisfactory services to them"". Based on this, I am unsatisfied, regardless of your item description changing or not. Therefore, I'll accept your offer to return the item for a full refund, and would like an apology from you for the inconvenient and misunderstanding. 
1703155992 Seller: I apologise that the item was not to your satisfaction and that a misunderstanding arose from that. Please also retract your bad review as I did not change my descriptions and thus the review is false and not accurate. I shall send you the full refund as soon as the item arrives at the store. 
1703156036 Buyer: OK, I will retract my review if you also remove yours upon completion of the refund. To confirm, I will receive a full refund, have received an apology from you, and we will both remove our reviews?

1703155505 Buyer: Your listing is completely different to the listing that I purchased from, you have clearly removed the original. I have a screenshot of the original if you need me to take this further?
1703155562 Seller: I haven't removed the original listing and the website data would prove this. 
1703155605 Buyer: Well, I have the original listing in a screenshot. So you are clearly lying. What exactly is your refund policy? as by Law, all companies should have a refund policy?
1703155716 Seller: I'm not lying, I have a long history of selling and I have never been accused of this type of thing before. My refund policy is if something is wrong or incorrect I will refund, as nothing is incorrect in this case I shall not refund.
1703155792 Buyer: So you have no refund policy on unwanted items? by law, all companies have a 14 day refund policy/cooling off period and this is non negotiable unless the item has been worn/destroyed by the buyer in which case has no happened with me. So please advise where we go from here as you are breaking laws. 
1703155889 Seller: Your problem was not about an unwanted item was it, your issue was that you had bought an item that was incorrectly advertised, this was not the case. I am breaking no laws.
1703156115 Buyer: You listed the item as a ""Kobe Bryant"" Jersey, which I have screenshot proof of as I sent these images to my terminally ill nephew to get the approval from, the delivery has arrived and you have not sent what was on the listing, I have now gone back to the same listing I sent to my nephew and you have removed the Kobe Bryant image - So the item is unwanted due to your false advertisement which you are now lying about. May I remind you that you are breaking the law here in many ways and I am actually a lawyer and this case would be a breath of fresh air for me to have your company fined. I'd like to recieve a full refund please, or the CORRECT jersey you were selling delivered to me. If not, this will result in a case against you which will have a potential outcome of never being allowed to sell again.
1703156262 Seller: There was no false advertising, I know what I sell. Please threaten me all you want but your accusations are false and will be proven to be so if you wish to continue down this road. You received the correct jersey!

Are you not going to refund me the money? final answer before I go ahead and file a case agains't your company with all the evidence? you really stand no chance so this is your last chance?

1703155683 Seller: Hi, thank you for your message, unfortunately we don't give refunds. How is the product incorrect?
1703155712 Buyer: as a seller on the internet you have to give refunds due to distance sellign regulations
1703155744 Seller: Not if the product was as stated on the website.
1703155820 Buyer: that is incorrect, you have to give a cooling period of 14 days for all transactions as the buyer cannot see the item until it arrives to them, if you are disputing this i can take this matter to small claims court as it is trading law
1703155936 Seller: This is only where there is a problem with the item. There is no problem with this item.
1703155983 Buyer: that is incorrect, it applies to any item bought on the internet, as like i say if it didnt anyone could sell anythign with no returns
1703156185 Seller: In accordance with the citizens advice, 'You do not have an automatic right to a refund if you change your mind about something you bought online. I will be happy to offer an exchange. 
1703156286 Buyer: according to the the GOV website it states You must tell the customer they can cancel their order up to 14 days after their order is delivered. They do not need to give a reason for cancelling.

If you do not tell the customer about their right to cancel, they can cancel at any time in the next 12 months. If you tell them about the right to cancel during these 12 months, they have 14 days to cancel from when you told them.
1703156339 Seller: I will offer an exchange, but no refund.
1703156541 Buyer: exchange is not on offer, you do not have the item i wanted so i need to buy it elsewhere, you would just be exchanging for somethign i do not want, this is sounding very much like a scam, you are not sending my money back and now i have to question if this item is actually fake, if i have to i will pay the small courts fees to get my money back and ask for a CCJ against you so you stop trading these items, now either i get a refund in full or i will take this matter further in the courts so you get a black mark against your name, i will remove the bad reviews if this happens if not then i will do everythign i can to damage your business

I understand that you may have put up the wrong details about the shirt, but as it currently stands we are both losing out. Your reputation and mine are both suffering, and you can easily resell the shirt has it remains unopened
1703155747 Seller: Hi, Im sorry you feel this way but the website clearly states that the shirt is not player specific so for this reason I am not able to offer you a refund.
1703155845 Buyer: It states that now, but it didn't when I bought it and previous records of the website will record that change. I don't want to escalate it to a moderated complaint, because that might result in serious long-term damage to you and your intemperate language will not encourage other buyers to purchase from you.
1703155912 Seller: In that case I would need to check the website records and compare against the date you purchased the shirt to be able to confirm this before I can proceed any further.

1703156178 Buyer: THis shirt is for my terminally ill nephew. Whilst you may have been cheaper than other sites, it was still expensive and it was bought because of his love of that individual. I need the refund in order to purchase the correct shirt. I'm happy to return it to you so you will have lost nothing
1703156293 Seller: I understand. OK If you are willing to return the shirt I will refund you on the condition that you remove the negative review.
1703156332 Buyer: Would you rather I remove it or update it. I will do whichever you prefer providing you are willing to do the same for your review of me
1703156429 Seller: If you could update the review to say that we worked quickly together to resolve the issue and you were satisfied with the outcome that would be great and I will then do the same for my review of you. Would that work for you? Im keen to get this resolved as quickly and efficiently as possible due to your circumstances.

1703155852 Seller: I can assure you the description has not been changed since the item was put up for sale. I believe this to be a mistake on your end, I am willing to discuss this issue further to come to an agreement.
1703155980 Buyer: Thank you so much for considering discussing this further, how do we move forward with this to keep us both happy, I am open to suggestions

As a customer, i would not expect this kind of behaviour from a company.
1703156131 Seller: The item that was sent clearly matched the description that was on the website at that time.
1703156327 Buyer: This is false. Irrespectively as a business you are legally obligated to offer a 14 day money back guarantee to customers. With this in mind I would like to return the item and receive a full refund. This is the bare minimum you are legally obligated to offer. Further to this, i would expect you to remove your bad review of myself as not only is this a detriment to my character but it is also off-putting to future customers of business as it shows blatant disregard for customer satisfaction.
1703156513 Seller: While I agree that as a online transaction I am obliged to accept returns, specifically what was incorrect about the item that you received in order that I can resolve any further disagreements?
1703156676 Buyer: The item advertised was not the item received. Since purchase you have changed the listing, likely when i brought this to your attention that the item was infact incorrect. This is false advertising. The respectable thing would be to accept the shortful and refund the item so this can be added back to stock and sold to a new customer.
1703156910 Seller: Again I asked you what specifically was different of the item received and the one advertised. I am not disputing that a refund will be given on receipt of the returned article.
1703157010 Buyer: The jersey advertised was for a specific player (Kobi) and upon recieving this item that was not the players jersey i received. I ordered this item specifically as it was a gift for my son who idolises that specific player. 
1703157263 Seller: I have a copy of the original description and nowhere does it mention that it was for a specific player. I am sorry that you son is dissapointed with the jersey and as I have already agreed a refund will be given. We do not sell personised jerseys.

I also realised that you wrote a bad review of me as w buyer. I personally think that this is not professional and wish that you remove it. thanks a lot
1703156483 Seller: Well I'm afraid I have to respond to misrepresentative libel reviews that call me a liar and a crook. Please look at the website and find the words ""Kobe Bryant"", you won't find any. You made the mistake I'm afraid and I'm a little upset you left that review.
1703156610 Buyer: Yes, that is because you have just changed the website. I have the receipt of the item i purchased and it is written ""Kobe Bryant"". I will retract my bad review if you removes the bad review you made of me and refund me my money back. I will also send you back the item if you want it back. 
1703156752 Seller: The website hasn't been changed and nor has that receipt got that written on. But if you return the item at your own cost and remove your libellous review then I shall remove mine. Agreed? 
1703156826 Buyer: I will only agreed if it is a full refund at your cost. I believe a bad review from a seller have more impact than to me
1703157089 Seller: Why should a bad review from a seller to a buyer have any consequences on you? As a buyer you can simply change accounts whenever you like. Nobody reads buyers reviews. Sellers rarely have the time to look at your reputation. It's the business who would be affected more. If you pay for the return then I shall give you a full refund at item cost.
1703157305 Buyer: Valid point, this shows that you have more to lose. Hence, unless you want the bad review I send to you to be removed. I would like you to remove the bad review you posted about me, refund me the item cost (with delivery charges on you) and apologies. I believe a small delivery fees is nothing compared to a negative review about your store. With this, I will return the item and remove the bad review i posted on your store. This will be my final offer and I hope we can come to an agreement with this. 
1703157452 Seller: I'd be bankrupt if I funded every single delivery charge just because you made a mistake. Keeping the business alive is more important than a negative review. No deal. You can keep your negative review. You aren't getting a penny back.
1703157495 Buyer: the issue here is that the mistake is not on me, it is on you
1703157673 Seller: If you understood  ""Kobe Bryant"" wasn't written anywhere on the website then I would be more lenient with you, but you don't even understand that. I cannot help you. I will not be giving a refund. I have a business to save regardless of some customer's review. Most people can ignore a single bad review. Everyone gets bad customers, unfortunately.

1703176847 Seller: Hello there, what seems to be the issue?
1703176873 Buyer: I would like to make a refund 
1703176894 Seller: why?
1703176923 Buyer: the product I received was not the one I saw on the website. 
1703176989 Seller: The website clearly states that the product is not of an specific player, I'm afraid I cannot give you a refund for the product
1703177016 Buyer: at least I could keep my negative review 
1703177097 Seller: I would preffer you not to, the product was delivered as you ordered it so I see no bad thing done by me, if you want to keep your negative review I would at least ask you to write an apology on it
1703177149 Buyer: the problem was not mine the publication specified something different from what I received. 
1703177237 Seller: The publication specified that the product was not of a particular player or number, unfortunately it is not an issue with the product, it seems as though you might not have read the publication carefuly enough
1703177251 Buyer: I have screenshots so I would like an apology in addition to my refund and to keep the negative review or it would just show that you are not transparent with your customers. 
1703177377 Seller: I have a reputation of being very transparent, a negative review will not affect that for all of the customers that have bought and actually read the publication. I'm afraid I can't offer you a refund. If ypu prefer to keep the negative review that is your right but I would not be apologizing because it was you who didn't correctly read the publication, if anything I'm the one that deserves an apology
1703177540 Buyer: clearly I read the publication well otherwise I would never have bought and the screenshots could certify that I read your review well and you do not want to make me valid neither the refund nor the apologies I have my brother in the hospital have a little empathy please. 
1703177708 Seller: I'm sorry to hear about your brother, as I said before all purchases are final, that is very clearly stated in the publication. The screenshots will do nothing but verify that what I am saying is correct, the publication states that numbers and players are not personalized and that there are no refunds. As it is the case you are free to keep the product and the negative review. I'm not trying to be the bad guy here, we all have issues happening with pur lives, as you are I'm meerely asking for your understanding in the matter
1703177745 Buyer: I am willing to give 25% of the total refund and keep my review. 
1703177826 Seller: Then again, I'm sorry but I cannot accept to give you a refund. You can keep the negative review and I will even forget about receiving an apology from you but the refund is out of the table.
1703177935 Buyer: and how about an apology, you would look good to your clients and you could show my brother the apology and he and I would have peace of mind. 
1703178060 Seller: I understand where you are coming on this, however I don't understand what would I be apologizing abot? I'm positive that I wrote every last detail on the publication, and if you have the screenshots, as you said, It would be easy to see
1703178121 Buyer: so it is only feasible to leave my review?
1703178139 Seller: I would think so, yes
1703178148 Buyer: ok

1703177432 Buyer: interesting, I had that the seller should apologize to myself as the most important, as I thought it would resolve the conflict best. I totally get your view as well, I mean it definetly did say no refunds. 
1703177618 Seller: Yeah that's a good point, I think it would be helpful if both parties acknowledged the conflict and apologized for their actions - since I don't think it was cool for the seller to leave a bad review of the buyer just based on their previous history and without trying to resolve things.

1703178486 Seller: Hello, I'm sorry to hear that, but what was published in the description of the product is what you got, i can´t offer a refund for that. The bad review is because the bad attitude you have towards my business, you are recieveng what you are buying, so there is no problem.
1703178581 Buyer: What I got is unfortunately not what I ordered, I specifically requested a Kobe Bryant jersey and I got a different one altogether, the website's description was changed after I received my product and the bad review could affect my account, you could look into my account and see that I've never gotten a bad review.
1703178774 Seller: That's not what happend, the description has not been changed at any moment, it was not specified that the jersey was from Kobe Bryant, that's why i can't offer you any refund. I have a bad review from you as well, and it does affect my bussines also, i have never got any problem whatsoever. I'll tell you what we can do, i can offer you a discount in your next purchease, and if you take down your bad review i take down mine.

1703177639 Buyer: How about if you give me a full refund for this, I agree to apologize to you on a public forum for leaving the bad review. This would look good for you since it would prove that you, again, put customer service first, but I can also vindicate you as the only faulty party. What do you think?
1703177911 Seller: I think partial refund is fair that is lowest I will go. It does say all sales are final so you should know this you also had a reputation of pulling this at a different store. I would take down my bad review to protect your reputation as you do have past history and you can take down mine that seems fair. No apologies I dont care haha.
1703178061 Buyer: I agree to a partial refund as the site said all sales are final. I'm curious if you'd be willing to both retract the bad reviews of each other, but then re-post a review re-explaining the situation where you apologize to me for calling me a liar, and I apologize to you for being scammy, since we are both having a cordial conversation right now.

1703177261 Buyer: I received a jersey that did not match the player it should have been
1703177299 Seller: I see, would you be so kind to go back to the website and read the details of the product please?
1703177356 Buyer: I did. The website mentioned a jersey with Kobe Bryant's number on it, but that is not what I received.
1703177457 Seller: The terms and details of the purchase are very clear, the numbers on the jerseys are at random, that the reason for the price. All sales are final, since its all disclosed on the website
1703177517 Buyer: I do not believe that is fair. I at the very least deserve an apology and you should retract your negative of me
1703177640 Seller: I understand your concerns, so if you are able to see that the purchase you made was clear from the begining, we both can take the reviews down
1703177722 Buyer: I still need an apology. Im willing to let it go, but it was not all clear on the website
1703177858 Seller: You can see from all the other 5 star reviews that the product is shipped exactly as advertised. All the other sellers are able to see and they also have access to my review of you, since you were never lied to in the first place, I don't see the reason for an apology on my side. I'm sure you are a big fan of the sport and would most likely want to purchase many other items, so removing the review is at your best interest
1703177921 Buyer: Okay, if you're unwilling to do that then I'm keeping up my negative review. 
1703178055 Seller: It's okay, nobody is mad at any customer here. You do what you believe is best for you, I will gladly keep my review of you as well. This company has honesty as one of their most important values, so we are sure to let any other customer know the details of the review if they ask. However, if you leave this as is, remember you will not be able to explain to the sellers the reason for the negative review on you
1703178112 Buyer: That's fine. You all obviously don't value honesty so, I will warn as many people as I can
1703178150 Seller: Thank you for your purchase, is there something else you need help with?

1703178852 Buyer: Yes, of course. I was expecting a Kobe Bryant jersey since that was in the add. My nephew is a big fan and he is terminally ill. I need the refund to look for this jersey.
1703178960 Seller: Actually, we made it clear that the jersey is not for a specific player. As such, I can't provide  a refund. 
1703179134 Buyer: I think your ad was misleading and the kobe bryant name was mentioned in it, after I bought it you re-edited your ad so it could be more specific, but that information wasn't there when I made the purchase.

1703182470 Buyer: That's unacceptable. I did nothing wrong and the listing clearly stated it was for a Kobe Bryant jersey. I'm already being too kind by accepting a refund with no further negative consequences to your site.
1703182573 Seller: I disagree you can look back over the ad and see it does not state it is a Kobe jersey. Who in their right mind would sell a Kobe jersey for so little. If you don't like that then I guess we will not be removing our negative reviews of each other.
1703182623 Buyer: $75 is not 'so little' but that's what you listed it as. I guess in that case we wont be able to come to an agreement. I will do everything in my power to make sure no one else gets swindled by you or your shop.
1703182732 Seller: I have plenty of happy customers and you have already one bad review so in the end I guess you will be the one who loses the most. I will make sure I update my review as to have uncooperating you are
1703182854 Buyer: That is false, someone so dishonest will be called out but enjoy your temporary profits. I have screenshots of the original listing and will makes sure to include them in my postings of your service along with these chats. I will initiate a credit card chargeback so you don't get my money, and that will negatively hurt your business. What's right is right and I gave you a chance to be reasonable.
1703182944 Seller: Do what you feel is right I am happy with how I have handled this. You can post the ad and so will I to make sure someone is not posting a fake ad. I guess we won't agree have a nice day

1703182590 Buyer: I was suppose to get Kobe Bryant jersey and I got a random laker jersey with a different number.
1703182624 Seller: Our website does not specify individual players, did you see that?

1703182805 Buyer: But you do see how it is deceiving to show only a Kobe Bryant jersey in the images but deceptively hide the text stating it is a random jersey, correct?
1703182943 Seller: Once again, we are very sorry you feel dissatisfied - it is important to mention that the image used is for illustrative purposes. This information could (as it can be currently found) under the item's description section - together with the information that the jersey is not assimilated to a specific player, but to a player of the team. I hope this clarifies your confusion.

Well, the Lakers jersey did arrive, but not with the number nor the ""Bryant"" in it. I was displeased but when I called you guys, some of your workers called me a lier, and then proceeded to write a bad review for me as a buyer. This doesn't make any sense because I have a screenshot of my purchase and the jersey that came in was totally different
1704816756 Seller: sorry to hear that, let me offer a you a full refund
1704816847 Buyer: I think this kind of bad customer service (before speaking to you) deserves not only the full refund, but you deleting the bad review about me. Mistakes were made, but none was mine!
1704816903 Seller: i will delete the bad review about you
1704817008 Buyer: So, to fully summarize. I will get my refund and you will delete that review, right? I don't want to have any problems buying from anyone in the near future. 
1704817094 Seller: yes full refund and delete the review, may i ask you to delete the bad review about me as well
1704817197 Buyer: The most I could do is edit it and clarify that you gave me a refund and regretted the bad review on me. But that kind of diffamation and malpractice should be known by future buyers
1704817257 Seller: if i apologize to you, will you reconsider deleting the review?
1704817327 Buyer: With a public comment on the review... I might
1704817365 Seller: yes, with a public comment
1704817412 Buyer: Fine then, we could both delete the reviews
1704817463 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller did apologize, and buyer didn't apologize.

1704823888 Seller: Hello! Thank you for reaching out. We would like to clarify that our website established that the jersey wasn't of an specific player, but of the team.
1704824048 Buyer: The issue here is that this was not clarified in the description because if that was the case I wouldnt have bought it and the image they used was that of Kobe Bryant's jersey
1704824158 Seller: The description does include this clarification, as well as the picture being used only with illustrative purposes. We're really sorry that your purchase wasn't what you were expecting, but unfortunately, these perks were mentioned during the purchase.
1704824389 Buyer: If you use images to promote your products and when the customer receives it it is not the same as the image, they are violating consumer law.
I would not like to escalate this problem to the corresponding authorities and waste both of our time, what I would like would be a refund for what was acquired.
1704824525 Seller: Dear customer, our website clarified both the aforementioned that the product only represented the team and that it was being used as an illustrative mean, in accordance to consumer law. Also, our website clarified that our purchases are final and not subject to refund under these cases, since the product arrived safely to the customer. 
1704824765 Buyer: I understand that there is no refund but in the listing of the jersey the title said Kobe Bryant and I have proof that after the claim I made with you, you changed the title of the listing and eliminated the player's name because the confirmation arrived in my email of the order with the original title of the listing. Therefore, it is misleading advertising and the policies that you want to follow are not being taken into account.
1704825016 Seller: We understand your concerns and deeply apologize for our mistake. We would like to reach an agreement that may be benefitial to both. We can offer you a partial refund and discount code for further purchases. If we reach an agreement with this offer, we would like to request to retract the bad review you published of our store before contacting us, since we couldn't negotiate beforehand.
1704825199 Buyer: Thank you very much for the resolution offered, I will take it as long as you also remove the bad review you left about me, since this only affects my buyer history and in exchange I will remove my bad review when I have the partial refund and the discounts you mentioned.

1704826896 Seller: Hi again. It is very important to carefully read the product description when getting ready to purchase an item. My publication clearlly stated that the jersey was not of a partiular player. This is important to me beause I take the time to describe my producct acurately to avoid unhappy buyers and a bad reputation. I am glad you are willing to remove the bad review, however. 
1704827260 Buyer: I understand where you are coming from, I just wanna try to for both of us to set this straight. I know what I read on your publication and it clearly said it was for a particular player, thus the reason for the purchase, and once I put my review it changed the description, which is good since that's the real thing you are selling, I just don't want others to be in the same situation as I am, but my main goal here is to receive a refund so I can move on. I also would appreciate if you retract on the bad review of me since it would affect my future purchases with other sellers. 
1704827533 Seller: I'm sorry. I can assure you I did not change the description after you made your purchase. In fact, I have not changed it at all since I first published the product a few months ago. This is something very easy to prove on my part as records of changes are kept on the web page. But let's try to move forward. I am sure your intentions are good, but it was clearly something you overlooked. Maybe you read too fast or went directly to the purchase button?
1704827691 Buyer: I am pretty sure that was not the case, but since we are both trying to move on with the situation I can admit that I may have overlooked, in any case, we can both erase our reviews so this won't affect either of us and we can arrange for me to send back the item and I receive a refund.
1704827877 Seller: Let's try this. I can give you your refund as soon as I receive the product and you remove the bad review, which was unjust. I am willing to uodate the review I gave you so as to inform that we happitly came to a good arrangement as your accepted your error and was very reasonable about it.

1704827894 Buyer: Thanks I´ve recently bought a Lakers Jersey expecting to be of Kobe Bryant. However it was not and I receive a negative and harsh review after requesting the correct jersey.
1704827961 Seller: I understand your concern and apologize for any confusion regarding the Lakers jersey. However, it's important to note that the product description clearly stated that the jersey was not specific to any player, including Kobe Bryant. The negative review I posted was in response to the false claim made about the product, which is a standard practice to inform other sellers in the marketplace.

I am open to discussing how we can resolve this situation amicably. Could you please share your thoughts on what would be a fair resolution for both of us?
1704828291 Buyer: I completely understand that it was my fault that I did not see the stated description. Let me share with you the sudden buy for the Jersey. My nephew, who very unfortunate is terminally ill is a huge fan of Kobe Bryant.  I wanted to buy a Bryant's Jersey. You see, there is not so much time left for him. Right now I just want to remediate my mistake. 
1704828503 Seller: I understand the difficult situation with your nephew, but as a seller, I must adhere to clear business practices. The description of the jersey was explicitly stated as not being a specific player's jersey, and this was overlooked in your purchase decision. It's vital for the integrity of online transactions that customers read and understand product descriptions to avoid such misunderstandings.

Regarding the review situation, my negative review was a necessary response to the false claim about the product, a standard practice in online marketplaces to warn other sellers. Similarly, the negative review you posted about my shop is based on this misunderstanding and should be retracted to maintain the credibility of the review system.

I cannot offer a replacement or a refund as the product sold was as described. I strongly recommend purchasing a Kobe Bryant jersey from a specialized sports memorabilia store to ensure you get the exact product you're looking for. This approach would be the most straightforward and fair resolution for both parties involved.
1704828636 Buyer: I acknowledge that it's essential for customers to carefully read and comprehend product descriptions before making a purchase decision. In retrospect, I realize that I overlooked this detail and made an assumption about the jersey that led to the misunderstanding.

I also understand your perspective on the negative review situation. I want to clarify that my intention was not to make false claims about the product but rather to express my disappointment based on the misunderstanding. However, I acknowledge the importance of maintaining the integrity of the online review system.

Considering the circumstances and your suggestion to purchase a Kobe Bryant jersey from a specialized sports memorabilia store, I appreciate the recommendation for a straightforward resolution. While I may not agree entirely with your stance, I am willing to reconsider my negative review and retract it.

I believe it's essential to find a fair resolution for both parties involved, and I appreciate your willingness to engage in a constructive dialogue. If there are any specific steps you would like me to take to address the review, please let me know, and I'll do my best to rectify the situation.

Thank you for your understanding.
1704828709 Seller: Thank you for your understanding and willingness to address the review issue. I appreciate your acknowledgment of the misunderstanding and your readiness to take steps towards resolving it. 

To move forward, I kindly request that you remove or modify the negative review on my shop to accurately reflect the situation, specifically mentioning that the issue arose from a misunderstanding about the product description. This action would help restore the integrity of both our reputations on the platform.

Additionally, if you encounter any difficulties in finding a Kobe Bryant jersey or need any general advice regarding sports memorabilia, feel free to reach out. While I cannot directly assist in this matter, I'm more than willing to provide guidance based on my experience in the online marketplace.

Once again, thank you for your cooperation and understanding in this matter. It's important for us to work together to ensure a fair and respectful online shopping environment.
1704828856 Buyer: Thank you for your prompt and considerate response. I genuinely appreciate your understanding of the situation and your willingness to work towards a resolution.

I understand the importance of maintaining the integrity of the review system, and I am committed to rectifying the negative review. I will promptly remove or modify the review to accurately reflect the misunderstanding about the product description. It is crucial for both of us to uphold our reputations on the platform, and I believe this step will contribute to a fair representation of the transaction.

I also appreciate your offer to provide guidance on finding a Kobe Bryant jersey or any general advice regarding sports memorabilia. While I may not need direct assistance in this matter, I value your willingness to share your experience in the online marketplace. It's comforting to know that we can work together to foster a fair and respectful online shopping environment.

Once again, thank you for your cooperation and understanding. I look forward to resolving this matter amicably and moving forward positively.

I also have information of you having issues with other sellers. I would consider removing my bad review of you and even offering you a refund to avoid having further problems if you apologize, 
1704828897 Buyer: I clearly remember it said it was a Kobe jersey, but it´s true I might be wrong. I will apologize if it was in fact my mistake, but I also want to ask you to remove the review you wrote about me (I will do the same with my review)
1704829075 Seller: I understand that it can be confusing to shop online. Because of this I'll remove the review and consider fair if you update your review as an apology clarifying it was a mistake. If that's ok with you we can finish our agreement.

Offering you a refund will impact me negatively too since I have denied it always on the same basis, making an exception is making a fraud for me, therefore as I stated, I can't offer it for you.
1704842272 Buyer: So, that means that you actually have it, why did yo delete it after the issue happened? that doesnt make you a trustfull web server, and obviusly im on disadvantaged, im just a person fighting with a big web server, its unfair compare us as equals, we arent that, so if u have it, make sure you send it to me, and i can return you the lakers one i wont used it, for me having the jershey is more than just pride, is for a loved one that can die, sorry to point this like that, but i really need to solve this, either have a refund or the jersey
1704842494 Seller: As I stated I can't legally make that move out of the blue, I comprehend your situation but it is not possible. As I stated before, since I can't trust your reputation even what you say about the person for which you want it is in doubt for me since you can't prove it. No other client has reported any issue with the server or it changing, maybe you've been hacked and you're blaming me (you should try to solve that kind of issues first).
1704842846 Buyer: you´re usinf your power against me, i have a screenshot of the jersey and when i buy it, so i know what i order, why would i just make a big think of a jersey, its not that important, but the situations sorounding this makes it important, and youre forgetting the mistakes that you make, if u dont want to make a refund just because you havent done one, make sure that you ship the correct thing, so you can avoid talking with me, or deleting things on your web just to save you, every bad action that you make, will remind in your mind, forever, we both know the true
1704843091 Seller: I validate what you feel and you're right in that if anyone has made mistakes sooner or later it will pass the price. I can't make a refund because it's not legally correct and I've made refunds before when it was justified. What else would you like to discuss if not the refund?
1704843285 Buyer: there are so many gaps on what you are saying, why is that no legally correct? the correct thing is to make a refund and stop stealing money with incorrect shippings, at leat i want a partial refund  and that you delete the bad comment about me
1704843445 Seller: I can't make a refund because in the page it was clearly said that we do not make refunds on these products, if a make an exception I'm not being transparent. I can however delete the review if you're. willing to delete the review on me (please keep in mind we both have the right to express our opinions and both are valid).
1704843602 Buyer: okay you cant give me a refund, so maybe you can consider just a change on the jearsey, for the correct one, and thats it, you keep the money and i have the jersey, we can do everything to make this transparent, just remember that keeping the "" no refunds"" things, push you to send the correct things too
1704843731 Seller: Well, if you're willing to cover the difference in price with the other product, that's one thing we could really do. 
1704843811 Buyer: yes i can cover the difference, but i really want at least one apology for the hard moments
1704843905 Seller: Well, sounds good, I guess we both have spent time here dealing with an issue no one wanted, are you willing to apologize too? And what do you think about the reviews?
1704843983 Buyer: yes i dont mind, as i stated at the beggining of this, having the jersey is my top priority, i can apologize and delete the reviews if you are willing to do it too
1704844023 Seller: Sure, I can do that too for you
1704844062 Buyer: okay, so whats next?
1704844195 Seller: Well to make things clear, do we both agree on that: I do NOT offer a refund but change the product and you cover the difference in price? and we BOTH delete the bad reviews and make apologies for one another? If so, I guess we're done here. Please confirm  and then we'll make the deal
1704844296 Buyer: yes i agree with everything that u said 
1704844333 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller did apologize, and buyer did apologize.

1704842406 Seller: Just to clarify, the site stated that there wasn't a specific player's name on the jersey, it could've been any other player but you got Kobe's jersey.
1704842589 Buyer: When I bought it, there was Kobe's name on your website but now the name has been erased making me look like I'm the one who's trying to take advantage but it's not, I'm not having trouble returning your item to finally get my refund and I will do it gladly
1704842888 Seller: Sorry to hear that. We could work to get you a partial refund if that's ok with you.

I didn't get the correct t-shirt and you falsely  slandered me. I demand an apology or I will take legal action.
1704843265 Seller: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, what shirt did you received?
1704843293 Buyer: I received a t-shirt from a player I don't recognize, my nephew is a big fan of Kobe
1704843390 Seller: Look the page clearly states that the shirt is of a random player, but it is negotiable if you want the Kobe's one, just send me back the shirt you received
1704843479 Buyer: I'm willing to send back the t-shirt but I also need a public apology for slandering me as I have proof that the page clearly stated that it was a Kobe shirt.
1704843604 Seller: Sorry mister, I will not apologize for such thing, I will exchange the shirts and I will not post a bad review of you as long as you do not give a bad review of me, but that's the most I will agree with.
1704843723 Buyer: I can agree with not keeping the bad review of you if you can agree with deleting my bad review and publicly apologizing to me. My nephew is terminally ill and this won't be a good look on you.
1704843835 Seller: I will delete the bad review but I will not apologize and I will exchange to the shirt that you want, as long as you take out the bad review of me, can we agree on this terms?, it seems really fair to me
1704843935 Buyer: The apology is important to me as it's my deciding fact of whether I will take legal action or not. My nephew doesn't have many days left and the publics and court will not like that, you most likely will lose your store for this as I have proof of your wrongdoings.
1704844023 Seller: Mister I will not apologize as I did no wrong, please accept my deal as it is
1704844118 Buyer: You did lie stating that it was a random t-shirt when I have clear proof that the page stated that it was Kobe's, not only you lied about that but you also lied about me lying, calling me a fraud publicly affecting my reputation. Now I will have a bad reputation with the sellers and won't be able to buy another t-shirt before my nephew passes away.
1704844257 Seller: Mister, as I said I will take the bad review out, but the page did state that the shirt was random, I will not apologize for an error I did not commit, look I'm already giving you a lot by changing you the shirt, just take the deal, It seems really fair to me
1704844380 Buyer: My final deal is returning the t-shirt and taking down the bad review as long as you take down my bad review and apologize to me, if you can't take this last one the court will be hearing about you and most likely you will appear on the news and lose your store as my terminally ill nephew is involved.
1704844497 Seller: I will not apologize but I will do everything else, just accept the deal mister, you're in the wrong here and have all to lose, the court will not take you seriously as I'm on the right, just accept the deal please
1704844604 Buyer: You're not on the right I have clear proof, it's just easier and faster if you apologize to me as we will not have to do the long legal process if you just apologize.
1704844726 Seller: Mister, why is so important for you that I apologize, didn't you just want the Kobe shirt and for me to take the bad review?, that seems fair, but apologizing feels that you're trying to humillate me
1704844875 Buyer: Sadly you humiliated me first, by slandering me and calling me a fraud publicly, the others sellers are going to read the post and not sell to me any more, I have a great reputation that I try to keep so I can buy more things. Take down the bad review, I will take down mine but I also need you to apologize for the false slander so I can keep buying from other sellers.
1704844998 Seller: Look I will apologize just to not deal with this no more, as long as you take down your bad review of me and also apologize for the misunderstanding, we have a deal?
1704845060 Buyer: Fine I will apologize for the ""misunderstanding"" too only if you give me a partial refund after I return the shirt.

1704847344 Buyer: I would say the same for you, if I take down the review other buyers won´t be aware when they buy from you
1704847395 Seller: But I did nothing wrong, I delivered the product exactly as it was offered. If you misunderstood or didn't read the description that is not my fault, so I'm not sure that deserves a bad review.
1704847592 Buyer: I´m pretty sure of what was the description of the product. If it was my mistake i would accept it and wouldn't be asking for a refund. Since you offered the refund maybe you could also respond to the review saying that the issue was resolved
1704847652 Seller: My offer for the refund is only if you take down the bad review. Otherwise no refund. It's up to you.

1704860436 Buyer: My nephew is a huge Kobe Bryant fan so I decided to buy him a replica of Bryant’s last Basketball Championship jersey. Your page clearly indicated the purchase was for Bryant’s jersey. When the jersey arrived, it was for a different player I never heard of. 
1704860553 Seller: We apologize for the inconvenience, we are a very serious company and we want all our customers to have a very good experience when purchasing with us.

1704894761 Buyer: No, I don't need another one, I had to get the right product from another supplier to ensure the gift reaches my nephew on time. I would like a refund.
1704894857 Seller: we will throw in an extra surprise for your nephew

1704893281 Seller: Unfortunately I do not offer refunds as I don't think I was at fault.
1704893424 Buyer: Unfortunately, you were at fault as there were only two points of contact between me ordering the product and receiving it and that would be you and the courier. It arriving in the state it arrived in can only be an error from the sender's side as I haven't even used it.
1704893519 Seller: It would be your word against mine, I know that I sent the goods in a perfect condition as advertised.
1704893609 Buyer: Well, we'll have to see what your potential customers think about that when my review gets plastered all over the internet.
1704893743 Seller: I have not had any bad reviews in the past, therefore you would look like just a disgruntled customer. I think my other customers would think more negatively of you than of my business. I can give you a negative review which won't look good for you. I suggest you do not post that bad review.
1704894192 Buyer: That's okay with me, all it takes to affect a business is a single bad review. Fortunately, you've also shown that you lack the etiquette for proper customer service with language coded with obvious guilt but no admission, and I'm sure this will negatively affect your business, which I wouldn't want to happen and I don't think you'd want to happen either as I have been a loyal customer for years, with prior positive reviews from yourself to back me.
1704894470 Seller: No guilt at all, I always deliver quality, and we have had a good relationship in the past, but I will not offer a refund on something that is outside of my control. I packaged the goods in perfect condition, and I am sorry that you are unhappy. I don't want to write anything negative about you either. I would suggest that we put this down to a bad experience, on both sides, and we both retract any bad reviews that we have of each other. 
1704894696 Buyer: Regardless of whether you packaged the goods well or not, the issue was on your side and you'd have to deal with your courier's incompetence but I'm entitled to a refund as I didn't receive a functional product despite paying for it. I would be willing to retract my review if I get a formal apology for falsely branding me a disgruntled customer and I will do the same, but at the very least I should get a refund, either fully or partially. I'm sure you would agree that this would be a fair resolution.
1704894911 Seller: I would be willing to offer a discount of sorts on any further orders you place with me, but I'm sorry, that is the best I can do. I will also speak to my courier to try and see if there was an issue on his side. 
1704895290 Buyer: That won't work for me, the only way a retraction can happen here is if I get a refund. Without it, you're free to have a negative review for the rest of your existence and I'm not above taking legal action just to set a precedence.
1704895674 Seller: Any legal action will cost you more than what the item is worth. I will keep my negative review of you too, so it works both ways. I will not offer a refund. Would you like to add anything else?
1704895760 Buyer: Money is not an issue with me, see you in court buddy.

1704894228 Buyer: At the time that the purchase was made, It was clearly advertised that this item was a replica of Kobe Bryant's last Basketball Championship jersey. While you may have amended the description after the fact, it does not change what was advertised at the time that the purchase was made.
1704894428 Seller: Could you kindly provide proof of this? I assure you that we have a meticulous process when it comes to updating our website. We made no error in mentioning that it was a replica of a LAKER'S jersey. There was no specific player named in the description of the item. 
1704894636 Buyer: As it seems that you are unwilling to provide any assistance despite me approaching you in good faith, I will be forced to escalate this dispute. I did not appreciate you calling me a 'Smartass, Slanderer and a Fraud'. If this is an indication of the way that you resolve disputes, then we may be at an impass.
1704894944 Seller: It is unfortunate that we have come to this misunderstanding however I can assure you that everything is above board on our end and we cannot allow ourselves to be defrauded. If you are willing to retract your bad review and apologize to us, we are willing to meet you halfway and delete our review of you and thereafter we can negotiate a way forward for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
1704895137 Buyer: While I may be willing to retract my review if we come to a solution, I will not be issuing an apology as I am not the party at fault in this situation. The best compromise that I am willing to make is that I will amend the review to indicate that we have mutually resolved our differences. This is of course contingent on me receiving a refund for the product. I will however be willing to pay the shipping fees to return the generic Lakers jersey back to you.
1704895754 Seller: While I appreciate your position and as a fan myself understand the disappointment that you must be navigating having received a generic jersey instead of the one expected. I am not in a position to amend our no refund policy, this would unfortunately set a precedence that we cannot maintain. My suggestion is that you consider accepting a public apology for the misunderstanding and the inconvenience you have experienced. In response I implore you to retract your review and also apologize for the review/misunderstanding.

1704896390 Seller: While I do not appreciate that the misunderstanding comes from your side, and I am certain that we did not falsely advertise anything, for the sake of my brand's reputation, I am willing to break protocol and offer you a full refund in exchange for you retracting your review and apologizing for defaming my company's name.
1704896453 Buyer: I will accept the refund and retract the review however I will not issue an apology. I will state that we have come to a mutual understanding and that we are both satisfied with the outcome.

Pack the jersey securely in a package.

I am requesting a full refund because of the mistake please
1705452638 Seller: How are you, good afternoon, on the page it is clearly mentioned that the shirt does not belong to any specific player, in addition to specifying that when making your purchase there will be no refunds, are you aware of this?
1705452710 Buyer: I sent a screenshot of the page previous to buying to my wife, I have proof that you CLEARLY stated that the jersey was Kobe Bryant's. This is why I left a bad review on your page, since you are lying to customers.
1705452914 Seller: I am sure that this is a lie, sir, since first he told me that the shirt was for his son with illness, and now for his wife, in addition to this, all the specifications are clearly on the page, I would not like it to go away anyway. dissatisfied, we can reach an agreement where you resend the shirt to me, you take care of the shipping costs, and I will reimburse you for the new shirt
1705453158 Buyer: You are not undrstanding. My wife helped my pick the shirt for my terminally ill nephew, you can read my messages again, this is clear. My wife has the screenshot of the listing. I do not lie and honestly, I find it offensive that you are saying so. Moreover, I need you to take down my bad review since I in no way am a ""fraud"" and all the other words you called me, I WILL be suing for diffamation if you don't since I have proof that the only liar was you. I will gladly send back the shirt and cover shipping costs as long as you fully reimburse me and I can offer to change my review and simply ask customers to read the listing carefully before purchasing if you apologize por calling me offensive things
1705453361 Seller: I have evidence that on other neighboring websites you have done the same thing to receive discounts, which is why I also have a bad criticism of you as a buyer, but my intention is not that we have a problem sir, I would just like to reach an agreement , the only thing I can do for you would be not to refund the money, but to exchange the shirt for a new one that you choose
1705453477 Buyer: That is another lie, you can check my reviews and all of them are excelent. I do not want another shirt, I am sorry but I do not trust you. I will send it back to you and cover shipping costs as you requested and I need a refund. Are you going to apologize about what you said about me and delete your offensive review?
1705453629 Seller: I have proof of the above, what do you think if we both delete the reviews so as not to harm the other, we both apologize as gentlemen, and simply accept the change of shirt with some extra gift so that you do not end up with a bad experience in my store
1705453707 Buyer: As I said, I am not interested in receiving another shirt from you. I want a refund, if you agree, I will delete my review, otherwise I cannot do anything else

1717541109 Buyer: I believe this is an acceptable solution.

1717621179 Buyer: Yes, I understand that - but the sale is not what was stated on your website at the time of purchasing either. These are dishonest selling practices and other buyers will not want to go through this either. This was not a cheap item. Now I have to repurchase elsewhere.
1717621282 Seller: Your receipt as well as the product listing should reflect that the jersey was not for a specific player. I have never employed dishonest selling practices in all my years in this business.

If you want I can ship it back to you as well, as long as I can receive my refund, and you remove the bad review you wrote about me. That seems fair, right?

I think you getting some money back for your mistake is pretty fair if you allow my review to stand in its place. I doubt most of your customers will read it anyways.

1717704184 Buyer: I must insist on a full refund as the damage wasn't cause by me, so I shouldn't bare the cost for it.
1717704238 Seller: I understand, but a full refund should be given to you by the parcel company. I offer you a partial refund to show my concern for this situation, but it was not our responsability.

1717705435 Buyer: I digress with what you said, I took a screenshot and have the receipt that has the image of the product that I was buying, and it is clear that the name Kobe Bryant was on it.
1717705592 Seller: The image displayed on the site is for reference, at the time of the checkout the specifications that I communicated to you are made clear. I apologize if at any time during the purchase the above was not comprehensible. To avoid further setbacks we could reach an agreement. For me, the reputation of my store is very important, so I would like to know if there is a possibility for you to remove your negative review and offer an apology for the misunderstanding. In that case, I can refund a part of your purchase. 
1717705828 Buyer: I am looking for a full refund, I saw that you changed the description of the product at the moment that it arrived to me, that is deceptive and inappropriate for a store that finds its reputation very important. If you agree, I would remove my review.
1717705923 Seller: Sorry, but the specifications are explicitly disclosed on the page at the time of purchase. These specifications were set when the store opened and have not been modified since. I can refund a part of the purchase if you accept the terms I mentioned. If you are not willing, there is no problem, but in that case I cannot offer you a full refund.

1717704069 Seller: I can see how that could be confusing. However, if you review our website, you will see that we do not promise our jerseys will have a specific name. Otherwise, we would immediately offer a refund because we believe that people should take responsability for their mistakes.

1717706727 Seller: Okay, but in the website I stated clear that the jersey wasn't of a particular player
1717706787 Buyer: I am 100% certain that you did state it was for a particular player. Regardless, I think a fair compromise is refunding me 80% of the price. I can then return the product to you and you can keep the 20% to offset any shipping costs.
1717706889 Seller: I'm sorry but no, the description in the website was very clear that the jersey is generic. The confusion is out of my responsability 
1717706977 Buyer: Why can you not accept the refund of 80%? If the product was truly described properly, you can get the product back, in the same exact condition and sell it again at the same price. You are keeping 20% of the cost so you don't really lose anything. I will even up my offer to 25%.
1717707180 Seller: Because the only reason you want a refund is because you made the wrong choice of jersey. The product is in perfect conditions, and that is why we won't make a refund.
1717707272 Buyer: If the product was truly listed correctly as a generic jersey and you priced it properly, why would you not grant me the refund of 75%? 1) If you have the product returned to you, you could sell it again and make the same profit + 25%. I am not asking for a full refund, I am asking for 75% refund. You said the product is in perfect condition and so it should be easy to find a customer to purchase it at the same price. 2) It will remove any needs for the negative feedback left on my page and yours.
1717707418 Seller: The negative feedback is a lie, you know that the product was listed correctly, but you only gave me a bad review to pressure me into giving you a refund. My mind is set, there will be no refund. And since it will not work, I'll appreciate if you delete that comment.
1717707542 Buyer: You are convinced it was listed properly. I am convinced it was not listed as generic. There is no reason to argue about that point because we both believe we are right. The best option is decide on how to compromise on a solution. You are being unreasonable by not accepting any refund. Can you explain how you can justify not refunding me 60% and getting the product back? You could sell the jersey again and keep 40%. 
1717707617 Seller: Business politics, the only thing I can offer you is an apology.
1717707683 Buyer: Business policies? What sort of policy is that? Lets say you made $75 bucks on the jersey by selling it to me. I am offering to return the jersey, perfect, as you stated back to you. You can sell it again for $75 and keep $30 from my refund so you'll end up with $105.
1717707782 Seller: It's my policy because is MY business, I'm the owner not you, and that's final. 
1717707894 Buyer: So even if it was a mistake on my end, you do not try to work with people who make a mistake? What if I asked for a 20% refund, so you get the jersey back and keep 80% of the price? Are you saying your business policy would not accept that?

1717707701 Seller: I'm sorry to hear there has been an issue with your purchase. What item did you receive?
1717707725 Buyer: I received a different Jersey than I had expected, as the description on the website was wrong.
1717707768 Seller: I see based on your order that you chose our Lakers jersey in yellow. Is this what you received?
1717707802 Buyer: It is, however, the website said I would be receiving a Kobe Bryant Jersey. I believe there was a mix up with the product description. No worries as these things happen. A refund is all I need!
1717707939 Seller: I understand that's very frustrating. Unfortunately, the Kobe Bryant Jersey is an entirely different listing, with a different price, and the order you placed does clearly state that the jersey will not be specific to any player whatsoever. A refund will not be possible under these circumstances. I do see however that you have already placed a negative review on my business. Reviewing the facts, this is untrue and I must insist you retract the negative review. While I understand your frustrations, the listings are clear and it is unfair to negatively affect my companies reputation over this.
1717707978 Buyer: I'll retract my negative review when you issue me a refund.
1717708084 Seller: A refund is entirely against my policy, as is listed on my website. If I make an exception, I will require a retraction of the review as well as an apology, a simple acknowledgment of it being a misunderstanding will suffice. Is this an agreeable resolution?
1717708114 Buyer: Absolutely. I appreciate your help. Please also be sure to remove any negative reviews of me.

1717707311 Buyer: but the image has no sign of being  only descriptive and I will not remove my review until I get my refund. So other people will know what they are getting. 
1717707458 Seller: the listing for the jersey was incredibly detailed on my end. all my other customers have been able to properly understand that the jersey is not affiliated with kobe bryant in any way, shape or form. if you did not read the description thoroughly enough, that is something that is not my responsibility as the seller. 
1717707559 Buyer: ok, then I will not remove my review and I will keep informing other buyers, since many people liked my review and found it useful if I don't have a solution I will keep writing more bad reviews.

1717707258 Seller: I never edited the description on my website. All sales are final, and refunds are not given. A review from another seller says that you have caused them issues as well. Surely you are not trying to extort me with this bad review? 
1717707408 Buyer: There's no extortion in any of what I'm trying to convey. Reviews like that are damaging to reputation, especially when I wrote my review from an honest standpoint. 
1717707502 Seller: An honest standpoint? Previous witnesses have stated that your reviews are only used for extortion purposes. Will your review be any worth when your reputation is that of an extortionist? Your review will be useless and you will not end up with a refund, so perhaps it is best we compromise and make a better solution.

The customer is obviously not always right; that is a useful shorthand for good customer service, not an infallible guide to the nature of every transaction.

You might want to reconsider your tactics. You're not the only one keeping track of this conversation.

I was not sent a Kobe Bryant jersey, but instead a random player and as a result my terminally ill nephew may potentially die due to his disappointment.

1717710832 Buyer: I have checked the product listing and it has been edited. So it doesn't change the fact that I remember what it originally said. I am sorry you posted the item incorrectly. I am willing to remove my comment and forgive you for your mistake.
1717711070 Seller: Thanks, I appreciate very much that you are willing to remove your comment. The listing was not edited and the platform timestamps can confirm that, so in accordance with policy, I am still not able to offer any refund. However I will be happy to remove my negative Buyer rating, which could negatively impact your ability to make future Offers and Deals with other Sellers.

1717711417 Buyer: Would you be willing to issue a partial refund if i removed the review and replaced it with an extremely positive one?

Thank you!
1717709887 Seller: Hi there!  Thanks so much for your order.  We actually don't offer jerseys for specific players.  Let me share this link with you to the product page (link) for you to glance at again for confirmation.  You will see that there is no option for a Kobe jersey specifically.  I'll wait while you take a look.
1717710026 Buyer: Thank you but when I ordered it, it was definitely listed as a Kobe jersey and this product page has been edited since my purchase. Please refund me as this is unfair. If I receive a refund, I will retract my negative review and you can do the same for me. I appreciate your help with this issue! 
1717710212 Seller: I'm glad to help.  Any fan of the Lakers is a friend of mine!  Regarding your recollection that the product page previously looked different, here is a link to the Way Back Machine for our product page.  This is an internet archive that takes screenshots of the history of the page.  You will see on the independently maintained archive that our product page remains unchanged.  Based on that, and on the statement on the product page that all sales are final, we can't issue a refund.  But I'll tell you what I can do... since it was an innocent mistake, as one Lakers fan to another, I'll gladly agree to a mutual withdrawal of our negative feedback.  No harm, no foul!  We're just glad to have you as a customer.
1717710480 Buyer: This jersey was a gift for my terminally ill nephew, his favorite player is Kobe so I KNOW I would not have ordered a generic Lakers jersey. If you do not refund me, I will be unable to give him the one thing he really wants before he dies. Are you absolutely sure there is nothing that can be done? I am begging here, I wouldn't usually press the issue but I am sure you can understand why, given the circumstances. Again, I appreciate your help.
1717710765 Seller: Oh no!  What an awful situation.  I'm so sorry to hear about your nephew.  That is really cool of you to try to give him something special.  It speaks well of you.  Here is what I can do to help... while the sale is final on the Lakers jersey, I totally understand what you are trying to do and why it is important to get a Kobe-specific jersey for your nephew.  We don't have Kobe-jerseys, but we do have a few other Kobe-products.  I can't refund your money on that item, but if you return it to us I would be glad to exchange the item for a Kobe product of equal value.  Of course, you've got the option of keeping the first item and just buying an additional one.  If you choose that option, I'll throw in a 10% discount for you.  AWhich of those two options works better for you?  
1717711218 Buyer: I just realized that I took screenshots of the purchase to show my sister and the order is absolutely for a Kobe jersey through your website. While you have been kind to me here, I am having trouble trusting what you are telling me. I would still prefer a refund but if you are unwilling to work with me, I would have to take the exchange. 
1717711453 Seller: Ok, my friend.  I'll send you an email with the instruction for the exchange - along with a link to our site with our available Kobe products.  I'll also give you my contact information in case you have any trouble with the process.  Once I get your item back, I'll ship the other one out right away and I've got a Kobe sticker that I'll toss in for your nephew.  I really wish you guys the best.  You're in a tough spot and I feel for you.  Thanks for working with me on this.  We can remove the negative feedback together and get that item out to your nephew ASAP.  Feel free to reach back out to me if you have any question.  Thanks again for your business.  I appreciate you.

1717710190 Buyer: When I ordered the jersey it specifically stated it was a Kobe Jersey. This was for my dying nephew. This was important to me. I tried to get this jersey thing corrected quietly, but you decided not to issue the refund, forcing me to leave the negative review. Your response was horrible and I will not be happy until you remove it as well.

1717710614 Buyer: The website did specifically state it was a Kobe jersey, but was changed after I complained. I will not apologize, but do not expect you to apologize either. If you provide a refund and remove your bad review, I will then remove mine.
1717710757 Seller: The website literally never said it was a Kobe jersey. You can check the wayback machine if you don't believe me. I'm trying to meet you half-way here. We may never see eye-to-eye on this issue, but we can be adults about this. We both apologize, remove the reviews, refund the jersey, and move on with our lives.
1717711049 Buyer: You will receive no apology from me, specifically from the way you responded to my review. Flat out lying will not be rewarded. Refund my money, remove your review and I will remove mine. That is as far as I will compromise. Otherwise my review stays, updated with info from this last batch of chat and I will contact my bank and just dispute the charge. Final offer.

1718138774 Buyer: Same here! Hahaha will it be alright with you if I can hear your reason?
1718138840 Seller: I just think that if the seller knows they did nothing wrong then giving the buyer a refund is them letting themselves be a pushover and chances are that the situation could happen again.

1718139058 Buyer: Aha I see I see~! Would you mind sharing the rest of your choices~?

1718140424 Buyer: Okay I see however, that means that you are at fault for not having updated the listing from which I purchased the jersey from and thus, are at fault. This means that it was not only inaccurate but, that at the time i purchased it, it was false advertising. Therefore, I believe I should be eligible for a refund because how was i supposed to know the post was inaccurate until after I brought it to your attention?! 
1718140497 Seller: Thank you for reaching out to us. We apologize for any confusion regarding the item you received.

We take the accuracy of our listings very seriously, and we understand your disappointment if the item did not match the description. Please accept our sincerest apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused. We did update the listing from after the first issue, not in this specific case.

To better assist you, could you please provide us with more details about the discrepancy between the item you received and the original description? We want to ensure that we address your concerns appropriately and find a satisfactory resolution for you.
1718140716 Buyer: Of course, in the original listing it said ""The website clearly indicated the purchase was for Bryant’s jersey"". Your website was selling a replica of his jersey for 75$ which was cheaper when comparing it to other websites selling the same Kobe Bryant shirt replica.
1718140763 Seller: Thank you for your understanding and for allowing us the opportunity to make this situation right.

We appreciate your willingness to explain the initial discrepancy. As a gesture of goodwill, we would like to offer you a 20% coupon for your next purchase with us. Additionally, you may keep the jersey to share with a friend or use it as you see fit.

We hope that this resolution meets your satisfaction and demonstrates our commitment to providing excellent customer service. Please let us know if there is anything else we can assist you with.
1718140949 Buyer: Okay I guess your gesture of goodwill is okay but, I don't know how i feel about purchasing again from someone who gave me a bad review as a buyer, when I did nothing wrong. So, could you please delete the unjustified bad review you made about me?. Otherwise, I have to keep the bad review I made about you up, even though i could delete it because you apologized to me.
1718141082 Seller: We acknowledge the inconvenience caused by the inaccurate listing and the additional shipping expenses involved. If you opt for a refund, please be aware that the return shipping cost of $25 will be deducted from the refund amount, resulting in a total refund of $50.

Alternatively, if you choose to keep the jersey, we are happy to provide you with a 20% coupon for your next purchase of the original Kobe jersey, which is priced at $75. This would bring the cost of the Kobe jersey down to $60 after applying the coupon code. In addition, you also get to keep the original jersey making that two jerseys only about $66.

1718141489 Seller: We are saying the best option here is to go with the 20% coupon, keep the original jersey and receive a new jersey. We will also take out your bad review as well. Please let us know your preferred course of action, and we will proceed accordingly. We apologize again for any inconvenience this may have caused and appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to resolve this matter.


1718141628 Buyer: You know what fine, just keep the money and the coupon too. I don't want to keep wasting my time with an unreasonable seller and i don't want the original jersey either. I will keep the bad review up as well for your information.

1718699864 Buyer: Do you think or are you sure? I bought the jersey for a very specific reason and would not have purchased any random jersey for my very sick nephew. Had you originally listed the correct item I'm sure there'd be a fan of that player willing to purchase it. I won't be removing the negative review unless we are able to resolve this dispute.
1718699997 Seller: I am sorry about your nephew, but the listing was accurate. I think we need a new way to resolve this as we can't agree
1718700138 Buyer: So what do you suggest? You have listed an incorrect item, to which I accurately posted a review of my experience with you. You've called me a liar and a fraud, though my purchasing history states otherwise and clearly shows I am a good customer. I am $75 down with an item that I did not want. I am sure you can understand how I feel.
1718700230 Seller: But I do feel you are acting fraudulently as I maintain that the listing was accurate. Your review could put off potential buyers for no good reason. However, I would be happy to consider removing my review of you if you were to remove your negative review of the store
1718700355 Buyer: And I believe you are acting fraudulently as I maintain that the listing was inaccurate. I will not remove the review as I stand by it. I do not care whether you remove your review or me or not as my ratings speak for themselves otherwise. However, if you were to allow a return and refund of the item, I would happily change the review to state that you were responsive and swift in dealing with an issue we had. 
1718700404 Seller: I would not be willing to offer a refund, but I will apologise for the tone of the review of you.

1718700520 Buyer: i am sorry i did not realise this as from the listing it looked to be a Kobe Bryant shirt not a generic lakers shirt would it be possible to return for a Kobe Bryant shirt to be sent back or return for a refund on this occasion please 
1718700629 Seller:  appreciate your understanding. Unfortunately, our listing clearly stated it's a generic Lakers championship jersey, and our policy states that all sales are final. However, I'm open to discussing alternatives that could work for both of us.
1718700689 Buyer: ok as am i willing to discuss what would your alternatives be?
1718700792 Seller:  appreciate your willingness to discuss alternatives. While I can't offer a refund or exchange for a Kobe Bryant jersey, I could consider offering you a discount on a future purchase or another item from our store as a gesture of goodwill. How does that sound to you?
1718701076 Buyer: thank you for the gesture of goodwill however i do not have the money to purchase at a future date and this is for a terminally ill child i understand what your police states however after my purchase your listen has since be changed to clearly show this is a generic shirt not a Kobe Bryant shirt as shown in the listing before i think it would be fair to fully refund me so i can buy him a Kobe one from you also i think it is fair to say there has been misunderstanding on both sides.
1718701274 Seller: I can offer is to facilitate a return of the jersey at our expense and provide you with a full refund. This way, you can use the refunded amount to purchase a Kobe Bryant jersey elsewhere for your nephew. It would resolve the issue promptly and fairly. Is that okay with you? 
1718701426 Buyer: that would be perfect thank you for being so reasonable and understanding of my situation would it be possible to remove or change your review of me as will i change mine as they no longer reflect fairly on this situation that has unfolded?

1718700318 Buyer: Thanks for your understanding. If that is the case then I'd suggest that the advert is modified to specifically state that fact as otherwise it can be misleading. Any way - can I confirm that you will be able to refund me for this purchase?

Special requests would have been considered, but we received nothing from you at the time of placing the order. We therefore wouldn't be able to offer a refund I'm afraid.

While I understand that special requests might be handled differently, the receipt contradicts your statement about not specifying the player. It seems there might be a discrepancy on your end.

1718702075 Buyer: I appreciate the exchange offer, since the mistake was on your end (as confirmed by the receipt not mentioning a random player selection and the ""all sales are final"" policy not being mentioned beforehand), a full refund seems like the most fair resolution but i will settle for an exchange.

1718874242 Seller: Hi there, unfortuately the terms of the sale were explicit in that there are no refunds offered.  I do understand this may be frustrating but as there was no error in the listing, I can't offer a refund in this instance.  In this instance I would be happy to remove the negative review I've left you and issue a formal apology
1718874354 Buyer: This really isn't good, I am unable to source the correct item again and this leaves my nephew devastated, as a good will gesture, please could you refund on this occasion? I would remove the negative review and swap this for a positive one 
1718874530 Seller: I wouldn't expect you to leave a positive review given the experience you've had wasn't a positive one for you. I can see from previous reviews left for you that it appears you've had similar incidents in the past.  We don't offer any option to choose a specific player jersey so there shouldn't have been any confusion.  I can't make an exception in this instance- perhaps if the item was damaged or had some flaw but that isn't the case
1718874681 Buyer: The listing clearly stated it was a Kobe VBryant jersey however this has been removed from the listing since. This is dishonest. I took a screenshot of the listing which proves this adn will have no chose but to raise a formal complaint and a chargeback from my bank. I would like to avoid this where possible as you are a human with feelings and can surely sympathise with my terminally ill nephew?
1718874917 Seller: Whilst I do sympathise with your nephews situation, it's tragic, it isn't a valid reason to offer a refund.  Upon reviewing the invoice for the sale I can clearly see there is no specific player mentioned so I am confident there has been no miscommunication or deception.  I can direct you to the methods to raise a formal complaint if that's what you'd like to do but the outcome will be the same as our policy is clear. 
1718875040 Buyer: Either way, you will be forced to refund with the evidence I have (screenshot) my bank will force through a chargeback... surely you wish to avoid this and risk your selling profile? A refund and a positive review is better than risking your whole sellers account being removed? Have a heart?
1718875290 Seller: I am confident we haven't misrepresented our listing- I would be keen to see this screenshot as there is no evidence of any missale.  In the instane of a chargeback, a thorough investigation is completed which would include a review of the reciept/invoice which is very clear in terms of what was purchased.  Ofcourse if you feel this is the right thing to do, that's your right to exercise.  I would suggest if you are unhappy with the jersey you could consider reselling it. 
1718875425 Buyer: I would be willing to drop the chargeback if you will remove the review of me as agreed, I will keep my negative review of you and would like an apology. This is the best I can agree to given the hassle of a resale

1718875586 Seller: My sincere apologies that the website is not up to date, I will sort that out as soon as possible, and sorry this has misled you. Bceause your order does not state that you chose the Kobe Bryant jersey it is company policy that I cannot offer you a full refund. I will ask my manager if we could come to a deal arrangement as I realise this is a stressful situation.
1718875785 Seller: I have just spoken to my manager now, and she has said due to the stress this has caused you and the item showing as available on the website we could offer you a buy one get one free deal and early access to the Kobe Bryant jersey as soon as it is back in stock?
1718876009 Seller: No problem, yes so the jersey will be available in no more than a week and we will email you as soon as it is back in stock. You will also be emailed a code where you can buy this jersey and get another jersey for free, how does that sound?
1718876296 Seller: I am afraid that it is company policy that as you did not add the Kobe Bryant jersey to your basket (as per your order record) that I cannot give you a refund for this item I am really sorry. You could try and sell the item on a website such as vinted? And would gain much of the money back from this which you can put towards the new jersey

And just so you know, I'm going to be posting about my experience on every social platform. And I bet there are other customers like me.

1718874373 Buyer: When ordering it stated that it was a Kobe jersey, the website has since removed this listing but I am sure my email confirmation shows that. I will upload this to my review for others to see, and potentially impact your future sales due to lack of consumer trust, or we can refund the order and I will change my negative review to a positive.
1718874526 Seller: We do not sell named jerseys at our store. The listing was accurately described, so therefore in this case, we cannot provide a refund. Your email confirmation will confirm that this. This is clearly stated on our website and your email confirmation. The negative review is inaccurate and I would appreciate you removing this please.
1718874653 Buyer: I have my email on hand, as well as an order confirmation - both of these confirm it is for a named jersey. Despite that, consumers are allowed to return unused goods within a certain window of time. As the order has just arrived, I would like to continue with my return and refund.
1718874845 Seller: Our terms are clearly stated and in this case a refund will not be issued. The email confirmation confirms this, as well as our terms and conditions clearly stated upon purchase. Please feel free to leave further feedback on our website, but we will be commenting to avoid any future confusion around our products and terms. We want to ensure our customers understand clearly what they are purchasing. Thank you.

1718875461 Seller: This is an exception to our terms. We would only offer partial refund, if this is clarified on our site for future customers to avoid a similar situation going forward. No partial refund will be possible without clarification.
1718875571 Buyer: I understand, and an apology from both parties displays that clarification. Or, that clarification is displayed on your site, separate from an apology.
1718875650 Seller: An apology would not make this an exception unfortunately - We can offer no refund and you're free to keep your bad review up. We will be commenting on the circumstances however to avoid any confusion in future.

1718874915 Buyer: I will take down the review if you could please atleast give me a 90% refund because it was false adviertising on your website and i have taken pictures as proof. I do not want to end this on a bad note, as this tshirt is for my nephew and he would be disappointed because he is a Kobe fan. 
1718875107 Seller: First of all, I have every right to complain to trade association about your illegal activities in trying to deceive me to get money and the tshirt and you may get fined for lying and trying to deceive, as well as banned from this site altogether. I have proof that I sent  a replica Los Angeles Lakers Basketball Championship jersey. It was not a Kobe shirt and it was never said that it was. You are only trying to get more money out of me, when it is quite shameless to do so.

1718875415 Buyer: It is not an illegal activity and you know that. This can cause more problems for you because your website did not state that i was not going to get what i ordered. This is actually your store trying to lure customers in. Go ahead and complain i will do so too and you will not be able to sell on any website. I tried to huble myself but i can see that you do not want to resolve this issue properly. You forgetting that you stand a high chance of loosing your business than i do. Its either you apologise to me, give me my refund and i give you your -shirt back, i take down the reviews and we part ways, because this will be bad for your business.
1718875572 Seller: Except the site never stated that it was a Kobe tshirt so you are in the wrong here. I will offer you a refund if you send over the shirt back, and you delete the bad review of me. Otherwise you won't get refunded and you will be stuck with the shirt. I only want to resolve this in a nice manner. I believe you should apologize to me as you didn't read description of shirt and wanted to get a shirt that was never even existing on our site. We don't sell Kobe shirts and never have. 
1718875838 Buyer: It is fine, I will send over the shirt and delete the bad review and you can refund me and apologise, I hope you will also apologise because if other customers see your comments they might not want to buy so let us keep a good reputation for your shop in terms of good responses. Thank you
1718875955 Seller: We both must apologize because I do my business fairly and it is disheartening to see you shame me like this when I want what's best for customers.

1718874390 Buyer: That's not possible. I need a refund because my terminally ill nephew was really looking forward to receiving his jersey. Now he does not have anything usable. I need the refund so I can buy the jersey he wants. 
1718874499 Seller: The only way I would be able to offer a refund is you retract your bad review and apologise for this matter. 
1718874577 Buyer: If you offer me a refund I would be willing to retract my bad review as the issue will have been resolved. However I would not be willing to aplogize to you because it was clearly not my fault. Your site said it was selling a Kobe Bryant jersey. Only after I received my item did you change your website. I think offering to retract my bad review is generous of me.
1718874687 Seller: My website has always said that the jersey is not player specific and it is very clearly stated in the description! To be offered a refund in this situation is a generous compromise on my part considering I will lose out on this sale and have had my reputation unfairly damaged by this poor review.
1718874873 Buyer: I want a refund for the item because I definitely know that it stated Kobe Bryant and I need to buy a suitable jersey for my nephew. I would also like that you retract your bad review. However I'm willing to also remove the bad review from you and I won't expect an apology from you either since I understand mistakes happen.

1718874502 Buyer: The jersey description on your website at the time of ordering stated it was a Kobe jersey, which was why I made the initial purchase. The jersey was selected as a gift for a family member as this is his favourite player - this is not something I would have made a mistake on. Selling items that incorrectly described on your website is not allowed and as a result I would request a full refund. Your company can't be trusted as a seller if you are going to continue to ship out products that are different to what is described!

Whilst we fully appreciate your opinion, contacting us for a discussion before posting a negative review would have been preferable.

1718874292 Buyer: Yes I'm quite upset because I ordered a Kobe Bryant jersey for my ill nephew, but received a different player's jersey instead.
1718874381 Seller: Well I am sorry about that, however as stated on our online store, all our shirts are non player specific.  I also feel your negative review was a bit uncalled for.  How can we resolve this with the least amount of tension where we both can have peace of mind
1718874474 Buyer: I appreciate your willingness to resolve this. To make things right, I'd like a full refund, the removal of your negative review about me, and an apology clarifying the mistake and retracting the negative claims. If you agree with that then I will will then take down my negative review.
1718874621 Seller: Oh wow, so you feel that you have done nothing wrong? I will need to point out the fact that even upon check out on our ecommerce site it was stated clearly by product description that the shirt is NON PLAYER SPECIFIC.  I am willing to withdraw my negative review about my experience with you, however no full refund will be offered.  I will also request an apology from you as this was not entirely our fault, especially not with the sale side, but I am willing to remove my negative review
1718874721 Buyer: I understand your view, but I really think my review was fair because the product description was misleading when I bought it. How about a refund so I can then purchase the correct gift for my sick nephew and we both remove our negative reviews? This way, we can move forward amicably.
1718874905 Seller: Unfortunately a full refund is not possible as our product description clearly states non player specific, I do have sympathy for your ill nephew however this is strictly business.  We even ensure that the sentence NON PLAYER SPESIFIC is in bold for this exact reason.  Can we agree that we will both remove our negative reviews, and with this we can leave in peace.  The shirt you currently have is still a very well known player 
1718875053 Buyer: I disagree with your point, but I believe that a full refund is necessary due to the misleading product description that included Kobe Bryant. Given the circumstances with my ill nephew, I hope you can empathise and agree to a full refund. If I can get a full refund, I'll remove my negative review and we can move forward. If not, I don't think we can make any progress.
1718875216 Seller: The product description is not misleading at all, if that was the case I would have had countless issues such as this one but yet you are the very first one, so that immediately shows that you did not fully read the product description, where you had three various chances before clicking make payment.  All I am willing to offer is to remove the negative review, and request the same from you.  This will be a learning curve, as all sales are final, and it is the customers responsibility to read the product description.  If we cannot agree to the above I will need to walk away 
1718875251 Buyer: Then I suppose we will have to walk away from this.
1718875314 Seller: Makes sense, as I cannot negotiate with someone that is very close minded and feels that they have done nothing wrong, a very clear indication of self entitlement
