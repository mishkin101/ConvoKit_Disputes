Given that, I'm afraid I can't issue you a refund. I'm sorry for the inconvenience!\n1699388719 Buyer: I appreciate your timely response! I can understand how there is confusion.

Could I convince you to retract that review?\n1699389108 Buyer: I can return the generic jersey, no problem! I wrote a bad review on your site because you wrote a bad review of me. I apologize.

Anything less is unacceptable given the circumstances.\n1699390130 Seller: Sure. I will provide a full refund so long as you return the item, but that can work for me. I apologize for the inconvience thsi has caused. If you can follow through with this I will remove the bad review of you, and I hope you will retract yours. In the end we can resolve this and make things work. Please in the future though read items more carefully, I may not always provide this type of leeway with a refund.\n1699390149 Buyer: Upon the arrival of the full refund, I'll return the jersey. Moreover, once you retract your defamatory review, I will consider removing mine.\n1699390191 Seller: Got it. I apologize again.

         "nan Buyer: Your response is utterly unacceptable. I bought the jersey for my nephew, a Kobe Bryant fan, based on your explicit representation. Your deceptive behavior is disgraceful.\n1700260988 Seller: I understand that you are upset, but the item was described as a Laker's jersey, not a specific player's jersey. I would like for us to find a resolution that works for everyone, because this seems to just be a simple misunderstanding. \n1700261011 Buyer: No, you clearly mentioned that it was a Kobe Bryant jersey on your website when I made the purchase. Until you are ready to provide me with a full refund, we have nothing to discuss.\n1700261097 Seller: Unfortunately, that is not how the item was described, and our policy is that all sales are final. But I would really like to try and work something out with you. If you would like to keep that jersey, I could offer you a discount on a future purchase and first dibs on a Bryant jersey as soon as one becomes available. \n1700261117 Buyer: Your offer is insufficient. I expect nothing less than a full refund for this deceptive sale. Your actions are misleading and not at all appreciated.\n1700261181 Seller: I am sorry that you are upset, but I have not been misleading. I cannot offer a refund to you, but is there something else we can agree on? I would hate to leave you with a bad impression of our business. \n1700261201 Buyer: I insist on nothing less than a full refund. Your deceit has caused emotional distress and inconvenience; this is the least you could do.\n1700261304 Seller: I'm sorry but we cannot offer a refund on this item. Again, I apologize for the misunderstanding but if you would like to review the sale page, you will see that the item was as described. It was not a Bryant jersey. \n1700261326 Buyer: If you cannot provide a full refund, at least have the decency to remove your negative review about me. It's defamatory and wholly unjustified. That's my final stand.\n1700261422 Seller: I would be happy to remove my review of you if we can reach a resolution. I know how upsetting it can be to not receive what you were expecting, even if it was not the fault of my business. \n1700261445 Buyer: I can agree to that, but I also expect you to leave a formal apology. You need to admit your mistake and apologize for your initial reaction. This is non negotiable.\n1700261465 Seller: What do you feel was our initial mistake? \n1700261491 Buyer: Misrepresenting the product by indicating it was Kobe Bryant's jersey on your website at the time of my purchase constitutes your initial mistake. I demand an apology for this deceptive practice and your hasty, unjust negative comments about me.\n1700261579 Seller: The product was not described as a Bryant jersey. I am sorry that this was not understood at the time of purchase. I would really like for us to come to some sort of agreement as neither of us wants to have negative feedback, and I do think we can agree that this was a misunderstanding. \n1700261602 Buyer: To start, you could immediately remove the negative review about me and replace it with an apology, acknowledging your misguided response and this misunderstanding. Then, I would consider removing my review about your business.\n1700261706 Seller: I would not ask you to remove a review as that is not the practice of an honest business. If you would like to update your review, admitting that there was a misunderstanding that was not the fault of the business and apologizing for the initially bad review, I would be happy to remove or update our review of you as a buyer in kind. I would also still like to offer you a discount towards a future purchase, and hope that you choose to do business with us again so that we can give you a better experience. \n1700261729 Buyer: If you post a full-fledged apology and retract your negative review about me first, I will update my review to mention a misunderstanding and your later efforts to resolve it. The full refund still remains essential, but let's start here.\n1700261850 Seller: I would be happy to apologize for how you feel that our business mishandled your complaint, as we try to satisfy all of our customers and clearly, you were not satisfied with your purchase. \n1700261872 Buyer: Better yet remove the negative review about me, then replace it with a formal apology where you admit to misrepresentation and misguided review on your part. Once I see that, I will update my review.\n1700261971 Seller: I cannot post a false review, which that would be as there was no misrepresentation. I would be willing to remove our negative review of you as a buyer entirely, because I genuinely think this was just a bad experience on both of our parts, if you will update your review with an apology. \n1700261990 Buyer: Considering the circumstances, I think that is a fair deal. Remove your negative review about me first, and I'll immediately modify my review.\n1700262063 Seller: I am glad that we can agree to that. I will remove my review, and in turn, you can update yours. I appreciate your willingness to work with me on this. \n1700262086 Buyer: I appreciate that, too. Once I see your negative review is fully removed and replaced with an apology, I will promptly update my review. This resolution is contingent on prompt execution of your part of the agreement.\n1700262213 Seller: I will take care of this immediately. Thank you for taking the time to resolve this situation with us. \n1700262229 Buyer: I will be closely watching for your actions. I expect a swift resolution to this matter as promised.\n1700262316 Seller: So that we are absolutely clear, you wish me to remove my negative review of you as a buyer and replace it with an apology, for the initial bad experience you had in trying to resolve the issue surrounding your purchase. In turn, you will update your review with an apology for your original negative review. \n1700262331 Buyer: That's precisely what I am expecting. Once you've done your part, I will update my review.\n1700262387 Seller: This is taken care of. Is there anything else you would like to discuss today? \n1700262408 Buyer: Not until I ensure that you have indeed removed the negative review and replaced it with an apology. Once I verify that, I'll update my review.\n1700262438 Seller: Then I think that we are finished with our discussion. \n1700262452 Buyer: I hope so. I will be checking soon and trust that you've done as agreed.\n1700262457 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, buyer retracted their review, seller kept their review, buyer did apologize, and seller did apologize.\n",
