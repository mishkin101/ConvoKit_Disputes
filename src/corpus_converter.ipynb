I looked over your purchase record, and I'm afraid it looks like you bought the right item--it's advertised as a generic jersey, not one for a specific player. Given that, I'm afraid I can't issue you a refund. I'm sorry for the inconvenience!\n1699388719 Buyer: I appreciate your timely response! I can understand how there is confusion. There were two options on the site. One for the generic jersey and a couple of specific jerseys. I had chosen the very specific one for my nephew and I think maybe I was shipped the incorrect order unfortunately! Is there anyway we could do a partial refund for me today? \n1699388896 Seller: Of course! We try to reach all our customers as quickly as we can. I'd be more than happy to get the correct item to you--how about we spit the difference? If you can return the generic jersey, I'll get the correct one shipped to you. While were talking, I was hoping we could talk about the negative review you left on my business--as you can imagine, that can be very damaging. Could I convince you to retract that review?\n1699389108 Buyer: I can return the generic jersey, no problem! I wrote a bad review on your site because you wrote a bad review of me. I apologize. I will retract my review of me if can you remove your negative review on mine and if you apologize. How does that sound?  \n1699389202 Seller: You know, that's a good idea. You seem really reasonable--how about we retract both negative reviews, each write an apology giving someone who stumbles by the review the full context, and we get the correct jerseys to each other?\n1699389315 Buyer: This seems very reasonable to me. I think at the end of the day we both just want a positive out come out of this so I am very happy with this result and I really appreciate you working with me on this. \n1699389355 Seller: Agreed! I'm grateful for your time. Hope you have a great rest of your day!\n1699389381 Buyer: I believe theres a few things left to say!! \n1699389423 Seller: Oh? I beg your pardon.

I demand a full refund.\n1701289473 Seller: you will not be getting a full refund from me ever! the picture was an example and there was nothing about kobe bryant in the description of the product\n1701289491 Buyer: Your careless attitude is noted. At least, have the decency to apologize and withdraw your negative review about me.\n1701289517 Seller: I will not be doing that either. You need to apologize to me and get rid of your bad review\n1701289533 Buyer: How about you apologize for misleading advertising, give me a partial refund, and I'll consider updating my review?\n1701289579 Seller: no that is not satisfactory. How about you apologize, retract your bad review and forget about the refund and I will get rid of the bad review that I made of you.\n1701289601 Buyer: No way.

The description for the jersey you purchase did not indicate a specific number or player. \n1701384439 Buyer: I disagree with your answer, as the only reason I would have ordered the jersey is because it had bryant's name on the jersey which is my son's favorite player.\n1701384523 Seller: The Image of the product included may have had a number but this was a sample of the Jersey design. The product description does not include this was a Bryant jersey or specific number. \n1701384624 Buyer: To me, that is very unprofessional and also false advertising. I would think you would want to act more professional and provide a full return policy\n1701384747 Seller: I do apologize for the confusion. As my policy states I do not offer product refunds. Again the product listing and description does not state this was for a specific player or number. As this was not stated there was nothing false advertised. You can also see this Jersey does not contain a player name. \n1701384875 Buyer: Well, I disappointed in your approach in this matter. I feel I must place a review post that explains to others considering a purchase that there is some deception on what the ad proclaims and what you will actually receive. Also your reluctant to refund my purchase.\n1701384995 Seller: Again I do apologize for the confusion but as clearly stated on the product description as well as my return policy your order was fulfilled with the correct product purchased. \n1701385059 Buyer: I guess I will have to file a complaint against you with my credit card company explaining the situation.\n1701385138 Seller: You are more than welcome to reach out to to your credit card company and I am happy to provide them the product listing as well as a copy of your order invoice/confirmation that includes the product description purchased. \n1701385228 Buyer: And myself, being in possession of the original ad which showed the name of Bryant and his number in the ad, will pass that on to the credit card company as well\n1701385297 Seller: Again, I am happy to work with your credit card company providing the information from the order placed and description as well as my return policy. \n1701385385 Buyer: Ok then, I believe that my negative review of your false advertising will cost you a few sales. I hope you feel that is worth you not refunding my money.\n1701385585 Seller: I will gladly provide the same information in response to your review indicating I am following all of my policy listed on my site. I would also like you to be aware that I will be submitting a buyers review for your purchase as well for other companies to be informed of your request that is against my store policy. \n1701385630 Buyer: Ok, I guess we will see who this hurts more.\n1701385663 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, buyer retracted their review, seller kept their review, buyer did apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1701385701 Buyer: Accept Deal\n",

Were there any other issues with the jersey?\n1701385426 Buyer: Well, I must have missed that part. I thought I was getting a Kobe Bryant jersey \n1701385494 Seller: Mistakes happen. Let's get past this. \n1701385550 Buyer: Do you think I could get a refund or partial refund?\n1701385648 Seller: Oh no. The shirt was perfect. I can't do anything about that. What I can do is ask you to remove your negative review and post an apology. In return, I'll delete my bad review of you. That way you'll still be able to shop on the site. \n1701385684 Buyer: I will not remove my negative review \n1701385712 Seller: I'm sorry to hear that. I think that leaves us at a dead end unless you have another solution.\n1701385759 Buyer: So you aren't willing to exchange the jersey for a Kobe Bryant one?\n1701385828 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, buyer retracted their review, seller retracted their review, buyer didn't apologize, and seller did apologize.\n1701385848 Buyer: Accept Deal\n",
