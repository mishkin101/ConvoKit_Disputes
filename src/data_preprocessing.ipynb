I looked over your purchase record, and I'm afraid it looks like you bought the right item--it's advertised as a generic jersey, not one for a specific player. Given that, I'm afraid I can't issue you a refund. I'm sorry for the inconvenience!\n1699388719 Buyer: I appreciate your timely response! I can understand how there is confusion. There were two options on the site. One for the generic jersey and a couple of specific jerseys. I had chosen the very specific one for my nephew and I think maybe I was shipped the incorrect order unfortunately! Is there anyway we could do a partial refund for me today? \n1699388896 Seller: Of course! We try to reach all our customers as quickly as we can. I'd be more than happy to get the correct item to you--how about we spit the difference? If you can return the generic jersey, I'll get the correct one shipped to you. While were talking, I was hoping we could talk about the negative review you left on my business--as you can imagine, that can be very damaging. Could I convince you to retract that review?\n1699389108 Buyer: I can return the generic jersey, no problem! I wrote a bad review on your site because you wrote a bad review of me. I apologize. I will retract my review of me if can you remove your negative review on mine and if you apologize. How does that sound?  \n1699389202 Seller: You know, that's a good idea. You seem really reasonable--how about we retract both negative reviews, each write an apology giving someone who stumbles by the review the full context, and we get the correct jerseys to each other?\n1699389315 Buyer: This seems very reasonable to me. I think at the end of the day we both just want a positive out come out of this so I am very happy with this result and I really appreciate you working with me on this. \n1699389355 Seller: Agreed! I'm grateful for your time. Hope you have a great rest of your day!\n1699389381 Buyer: I believe theres a few things left to say!! \n1699389423 Seller: Oh? I beg your pardon.

Your behavior is disappointing, and your negative review is unfounded.\n1699390723 Buyer: I don't care for your policy. If you want my review to be removed then you should give me the refund i rightfully deserve. Its shady business to use vague product descriptions to your advantage like this. The fact the that jersey I received is different from the picture is poof enough\n1699390746 Seller: The jersey you received matches the clear description on our website. However, I propose a partial refund if your negative review is removed in an effort to resolve this matter amicably. It seems fair to me.\n1699391038 Buyer: I either get a full refund or no deal. I don't care for the bad review you wrote on my account because people are entitled to their opinion. The fact that you care so much about my review tells me you just don't want other people finding out about your scam.The item may technically match the description but it's purposely written to be vague and like i stated the product image was different. If the description was truly accurate it would state that the buyer may receive a different player than the image.\n1699391062 Seller: I deeply resented being called a scammer. Reflecting on this situation, if you remove your negative review, I will provide you with a full refund. I trust this will bring an end to our dispute.\n1699391107 Buyer: sure I'm cool with that, just remove your review as well and we can forget this ever happened.\n1699391130 Seller: No need for you to worry, as soon as the negative review is removed from our website, I will delete my review of you. This way we all remain satisfied.\n1699391214 Buyer: No I definitely need to see that refund first. quite frankly I do not trust you, this transaction has been very shady.\n1699391235 Seller: I understand your concerns, but let's do it in tandem. Remove your review and I'll issue the refund. It ensures both parties act in good faith.\n1699391485 Buyer: Sorry but no deal, from the start of this interaction all you cared about was the fact that I left a bad review and I still think you're a scammer. I think it's nice of me to even agree to taking the review down in the first place (also I'm dragging it on bc we have to write more)\n1699391508 Seller: Alright, let's settle this. You remove your negative review, I'll immediately issue the full refund and remove my review of you. This should reestablish both our reputations. Fair enough?\n1699391569 Buyer: I see you're completely not listening, until i see that refund that review will continue to stay on your account. bottom line i do not trust you.\n1699391588 Seller: Fine. I will issue your refund first. After you confirm receiving it, I expect you to remove the negative review. Keep me updated.\n1699391686 Buyer: thank you, I'm glad we could come to an arrangement I'm looking for the refund right now\n1699391699 Seller: Great! Please ensure to remove that review once you've confirmed the refund. Thanks.\n1699391756 Buyer: yep I see it now, I'm going to remove the negative review i left you. I can assume you're removing the one you wrote about me as well?\n1699391774 Seller: Yes, I am removing the review I wrote about you. Let's consider this matter closed. Thank you for your understanding.\n1699391832 Buyer: great thank you for cooperating, maybe you should fix your product description so this doesn't happen again.\n1699391842 Seller: Point taken. We'll definitely consider your feedback. Thank you.\n1699391851 Buyer: yep thank you as well\n1699391859 Seller: You're welcome. Have a great day!\n1699391869 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, buyer retracted their review, seller retracted their review, buyer didn't apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n",

I know we need to continue to correspond, so do you know when your Kobe jersey's will arrive?\n1699392568 Seller: I do have a shipment coming in next week. That one costs more but I could get you one if you wish.\n1699392599 Buyer: That is fine. I'm more than happy to pay more for the jersey that will make him happy.

         "nan Seller: Your sudden demand for a refund is unwarranted. Our product description is crystal clear, and we stand by our policy. Your behavior is disappointing, and your negative review is unfounded.\n1699669206 Buyer: Why would you say that? You sent me the wrong jersey and I paid for it.\n1699669228 Seller: The product description was very clear that it was not a specific player jersey. However, to put an end to this matter, I'd be willing to offer a partial refund if you remove your unfounded negative review.\n1699669312 Buyer: We both know the site speciffically said it was a Kobe Bryant jersey. How about a full refund and I'll return the jersey?\n1699669333 Seller: I'm certain the listing did not specify a Kobe Bryant jersey. However, if you remove your false negative review, I will reconsider a full refund.\n1699669423 Buyer: I'll remove the review if you give a full refund and remove your false negative review. We both come away as if it never happened.\n1699669446 Seller: If you agree to remove your negative review immediately, I will provide a full refund and retract my review about you as well. This seems to me like a fair solution.\n1699669550 Buyer: Sounds like a fair solution to me too.\n1699669569 Seller: Perfect, let's agree on this then. Once your review is removed, the full refund process will be initiated and my review will be retracted.\n1699669695 Buyer: To show good faith, how about you start the full refund process immediately, then I'll take down the review, then you can take down your review?\n1699669715 Seller: Agreed. Removing negative reviews by both parties will clear the air. I'll start the refund once your review is off. Prompt action is appreciated.\n1699669794 Buyer: Yeah, let's start with the refund first and then I'll follow with the review and then you can follow after that. I think it's a fair plan that eases into full resolution.\n1699669813 Seller: I have to insist that the negative review be removed first, then the refund process will commence immediately. We appreciate your understanding.\n1699669944 Buyer: Sorry, that doesn't make me comfortable or show me good faith. What can we do to resolve that?\n1699669965 Seller: I understand your concern, but the terms are clear. Remove your feedback first, and your refund will be processed right away. Let's move ahead maturely.\n1699670057 Buyer: There's been no conflict in this conversation. I've stated I'm uncomfortable with your terms and would like a show of good faith to create trust. What can you do to help that?\n1699670077 Seller: Given the circumstances, I will initiate the refund process, and I trust you to remove your negative review promptly. Let's proceed in good faith.\n1699670191 Buyer: Thank-you. I appreciate that and will follow with my committment accordingly when the refund has been completed. Are we at a point of finalizing the deal?\n1699670211 Seller: Yes, we are. A full refund will be initiated immediately. I anticipate your negative review will be taken down promptly. We can consider this resolved.\n1699670283 Buyer: Great! We can look forward to having both reviews pulled down.\n1699670303 Seller: Absolutely! Once the refund is completed and your review removed, my review will be immediately retracted. Thank you for reaching a resolution with us.\n1699670331 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, buyer retracted their review, seller retracted their review, buyer didn't apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n",

I'm willing to take down my negative review as soon as you ship the jersey and remove your negative review.

         "nan Buyer: Your response is utterly unacceptable. I bought the jersey for my nephew, a Kobe Bryant fan, based on your explicit representation. Your deceptive behavior is disgraceful.\n1700260988 Seller: I understand that you are upset, but the item was described as a Laker's jersey, not a specific player's jersey. I would like for us to find a resolution that works for everyone, because this seems to just be a simple misunderstanding. \n1700261011 Buyer: No, you clearly mentioned that it was a Kobe Bryant jersey on your website when I made the purchase. Until you are ready to provide me with a full refund, we have nothing to discuss.\n1700261097 Seller: Unfortunately, that is not how the item was described, and our policy is that all sales are final. But I would really like to try and work something out with you. If you would like to keep that jersey, I could offer you a discount on a future purchase and first dibs on a Bryant jersey as soon as one becomes available. \n1700261117 Buyer: Your offer is insufficient. I expect nothing less than a full refund for this deceptive sale. Your actions are misleading and not at all appreciated.\n1700261181 Seller: I am sorry that you are upset, but I have not been misleading. I cannot offer a refund to you, but is there something else we can agree on? I would hate to leave you with a bad impression of our business. \n1700261201 Buyer: I insist on nothing less than a full refund. Your deceit has caused emotional distress and inconvenience; this is the least you could do.\n1700261304 Seller: I'm sorry but we cannot offer a refund on this item. Again, I apologize for the misunderstanding but if you would like to review the sale page, you will see that the item was as described. It was not a Bryant jersey. \n1700261326 Buyer: If you cannot provide a full refund, at least have the decency to remove your negative review about me. It's defamatory and wholly unjustified. That's my final stand.\n1700261422 Seller: I would be happy to remove my review of you if we can reach a resolution. I know how upsetting it can be to not receive what you were expecting, even if it was not the fault of my business. \n1700261445 Buyer: I can agree to that, but I also expect you to leave a formal apology. You need to admit your mistake and apologize for your initial reaction. This is non negotiable.\n1700261465 Seller: What do you feel was our initial mistake? \n1700261491 Buyer: Misrepresenting the product by indicating it was Kobe Bryant's jersey on your website at the time of my purchase constitutes your initial mistake. I demand an apology for this deceptive practice and your hasty, unjust negative comments about me.\n1700261579 Seller: The product was not described as a Bryant jersey. I am sorry that this was not understood at the time of purchase. I would really like for us to come to some sort of agreement as neither of us wants to have negative feedback, and I do think we can agree that this was a misunderstanding. \n1700261602 Buyer: To start, you could immediately remove the negative review about me and replace it with an apology, acknowledging your misguided response and this misunderstanding. Then, I would consider removing my review about your business.\n1700261706 Seller: I would not ask you to remove a review as that is not the practice of an honest business. If you would like to update your review, admitting that there was a misunderstanding that was not the fault of the business and apologizing for the initially bad review, I would be happy to remove or update our review of you as a buyer in kind. I would also still like to offer you a discount towards a future purchase, and hope that you choose to do business with us again so that we can give you a better experience. \n1700261729 Buyer: If you post a full-fledged apology and retract your negative review about me first, I will update my review to mention a misunderstanding and your later efforts to resolve it. The full refund still remains essential, but let's start here.\n1700261850 Seller: I would be happy to apologize for how you feel that our business mishandled your complaint, as we try to satisfy all of our customers and clearly, you were not satisfied with your purchase. \n1700261872 Buyer: Better yet remove the negative review about me, then replace it with a formal apology where you admit to misrepresentation and misguided review on your part. Once I see that, I will update my review.\n1700261971 Seller: I cannot post a false review, which that would be as there was no misrepresentation. I would be willing to remove our negative review of you as a buyer entirely, because I genuinely think this was just a bad experience on both of our parts, if you will update your review with an apology. \n1700261990 Buyer: Considering the circumstances, I think that is a fair deal. Remove your negative review about me first, and I'll immediately modify my review.\n1700262063 Seller: I am glad that we can agree to that. I will remove my review, and in turn, you can update yours. I appreciate your willingness to work with me on this. \n1700262086 Buyer: I appreciate that, too. Once I see your negative review is fully removed and replaced with an apology, I will promptly update my review. This resolution is contingent on prompt execution of your part of the agreement.\n1700262213 Seller: I will take care of this immediately. Thank you for taking the time to resolve this situation with us. \n1700262229 Buyer: I will be closely watching for your actions. I expect a swift resolution to this matter as promised.\n1700262316 Seller: So that we are absolutely clear, you wish me to remove my negative review of you as a buyer and replace it with an apology, for the initial bad experience you had in trying to resolve the issue surrounding your purchase. In turn, you will update your review with an apology for your original negative review. \n1700262331 Buyer: That's precisely what I am expecting. Once you've done your part, I will update my review.\n1700262387 Seller: This is taken care of. Is there anything else you would like to discuss today? \n1700262408 Buyer: Not until I ensure that you have indeed removed the negative review and replaced it with an apology. Once I verify that, I'll update my review.\n1700262438 Seller: Then I think that we are finished with our discussion. \n1700262452 Buyer: I hope so. I will be checking soon and trust that you've done as agreed.\n1700262457 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, buyer retracted their review, seller kept their review, buyer did apologize, and seller did apologize.\n",

If you remove your negative review, I'm willing to issue a partial refund of $25. Remember, you didn't read our clearly stated product description and return policy.\n1700264519 Buyer: When I purchased the product Kobe Bryant's name was clearly stated and now the page is missing his name. the only reason I made the purchase was because it showed a Kobe Bryant jersey. A partial refund is not acceptable because I did not receive the correct item. Id you are willing to send the correct item and pay for the incorrect item to be shipped back to you then this would be acceptable to me.\n1700264542 Seller: My apologies, but providing the specific Kobe Bryant jersey or paying for return shipping is not feasible. If you take down your negative review, I can raise the partial refund to $35.

Giving him a generic Laker's jersey wasn't the point of the purchase. i could have gotten one for a lot less than $75. I'm willing to take down my review of you if you first take down your review of me. Considering it's a generic jersey I would be willing to accept a $45 refund. That way I would be paying $30 for a generic jersey which i think is a fair amount.\n1700264803 Seller: I sympathize, and understand this was meant to be special. The jersey is not generic but a championship one. As an exceptional act, I'm willing to issue a $45 refund in exchange for review removal.

    "\n",
    "    volume_up\n",
    "    A tomato's flavor is a complex dance between sweetness and acidity. Here's a breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sweetness: Comes from natural sugars like fructose and glucose.\n",
    "    Acidity: Stems from citric and malic acids, giving tomatoes a tangy or tart kick.\n",
    "    These elements combine to create a flavor profile that can be described as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sweet-tart: This is the classic tomato flavor, where the sweetness and acidity are balanced.\n",
    "    Sweeter: Some tomato varieties, especially cherry tomatoes, are bred to have a higher sugar content, making them taste sweeter.\n",
    "    More acidic: These tomatoes have a stronger tang or sourness.\n",
    "    Bland: If a tomato has low levels of both sugar and acid, it might taste bland.\n",
    "    There are other factors that influence tomato flavor:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Variety: There are hundreds of tomato varieties, each with its own unique flavor profile. For instance, some heirloom tomatoes are known for their intense, complex flavors.\n",
    "    Ripeness: A perfectly ripe tomato will have the best flavor balance. Underripe tomatoes can be tart, while overripe ones may lose their acidity.\n",
    "    Overall, the flavor of a tomato is a delightful combination of sweet and tart, with variations depending on the variety and ripeness.\n",

When the jersey arrived, it was for a different player you never heard of. You request the correct jersey be sent.\n",

    "    Reasoning: Considering the situation with my nephew, receiving the correct jersey as quickly as possible is crucial. Since the seller is at fault for the mistake, they should be responsible for any expedited shipping costs to ensure my nephew can enjoy the jersey before it's too late.\n",
    "    3. Partial Refund:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reasoning: The website advertised a specific product (Kobe Bryant jersey) at a specific price. Due to the seller's deceptive practices, I was not given the product I paid for. A partial refund would acknowledge the inconvenience and wasted time caused by this situation.\n",
    "    4. Seller Review Removal:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reasoning: The seller's negative review (\"SMARTASS, SLANDERER and a FRAUD\") is completely false and tarnishes my reputation on the website. Its removal is essential to restore my good standing and ensure other sellers are willing to do business with me.\n",
    "    5. Public Apology from Seller:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reasoning: The seller's deceptive advertising and false review not only hurt me but potentially misled other customers. A public apology would acknowledge their wrongdoing and deter them from similar behavior in the future.\n",
    "    Remember: While all these issues are important, prioritize getting the Kobe Bryant jersey for your nephew as quickly as possible.\n",
