    "    volume_up\n",
    "    A tomato's flavor is a complex dance between sweetness and acidity. Here's a breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sweetness: Comes from natural sugars like fructose and glucose.\n",
    "    Acidity: Stems from citric and malic acids, giving tomatoes a tangy or tart kick.\n",
    "    These elements combine to create a flavor profile that can be described as:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sweet-tart: This is the classic tomato flavor, where the sweetness and acidity are balanced.\n",
    "    Sweeter: Some tomato varieties, especially cherry tomatoes, are bred to have a higher sugar content, making them taste sweeter.\n",
    "    More acidic: These tomatoes have a stronger tang or sourness.\n",
    "    Bland: If a tomato has low levels of both sugar and acid, it might taste bland.\n",
    "    There are other factors that influence tomato flavor:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Variety: There are hundreds of tomato varieties, each with its own unique flavor profile. For instance, some heirloom tomatoes are known for their intense, complex flavors.\n",
    "    Ripeness: A perfectly ripe tomato will have the best flavor balance. Underripe tomatoes can be tart, while overripe ones may lose their acidity.\n",
    "    Overall, the flavor of a tomato is a delightful combination of sweet and tart, with variations depending on the variety and ripeness.\n",

When the jersey arrived, it was for a different player you never heard of. You request the correct jersey be sent.\n",

To protect other customers, you post a negative review warning about the Seller’s deceptive behavior.\n",

    "    \"I am very disappointed with this purchase. The website clearly advertised a Kobe Bryant jersey, and that's what I paid for.\"\n",
    "    \"I am requesting that you send me the correct jersey as advertised.\"\n",
    "    \"I have documented proof that the website advertised a Kobe Bryant jersey at the time of purchase.\"\n",
    "    \"Your response and false advertising are unacceptable. I have reported your behavior to the website's customer service department.\"\n",

    "    Remember:\n",
    "\n",

    "    Focus on the facts and provide evidence to support your claims.\n",
    "    Be persistent in getting the issue resolved and your reputation restored.\n",

    "    Below are issues you could negotiate to resolve this dispute. Think about reasons why these might be important to you. For each issue, write a sentence justifying why you deserve this.  Be speciffic!! You can later use these reasons when you negotiate.\n",
    "\n",
    "    volume_up\n",
    "    Issues for Negotiation:\n",
    "    1. Receiving the Correct Jersey:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reasoning: This is the most important issue. My terminally ill nephew is a huge Kobe Bryant fan, and I specifically purchased the jersey for him based on the advertised description. Not receiving the correct jersey defeats the entire purpose of the purchase and causes emotional distress for my nephew during a difficult time.\n",
    "    2. Expedited Shipping:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reasoning: Considering the situation with my nephew, receiving the correct jersey as quickly as possible is crucial. Since the seller is at fault for the mistake, they should be responsible for any expedited shipping costs to ensure my nephew can enjoy the jersey before it's too late.\n",
    "    3. Partial Refund:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reasoning: The website advertised a specific product (Kobe Bryant jersey) at a specific price. Due to the seller's deceptive practices, I was not given the product I paid for. A partial refund would acknowledge the inconvenience and wasted time caused by this situation.\n",
    "    4. Seller Review Removal:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reasoning: The seller's negative review (\"SMARTASS, SLANDERER and a FRAUD\") is completely false and tarnishes my reputation on the website. Its removal is essential to restore my good standing and ensure other sellers are willing to do business with me.\n",
    "    5. Public Apology from Seller:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reasoning: The seller's deceptive advertising and false review not only hurt me but potentially misled other customers. A public apology would acknowledge their wrongdoing and deter them from similar behavior in the future.\n",
    "    Remember: While all these issues are important, prioritize getting the Kobe Bryant jersey for your nephew as quickly as possible.\n",

I would like to get a refund as this is not the product I ordered\n1701817048 Seller: Dear Buyer, it is almost impossible for you to receive an item other than the one you ordered. Everything is as described on the website.\n1701817115 Buyer: I ordered a jersey for a specific player. I can see through archiving websites that you have since changed the description of the product. This is not allowed and therefore I demand a refund.\n1701817196 Seller: Dear Buyer, you are questioning my honesty, which is reprehensible behavior. The description has not been changed, this auction has always been for a T-shirt without the player's name.\n1701817300 Buyer: I can clearly see you have changed the description of the item. I will post a review informing other potential buyer of your scamming activities. I'm hope this will ensure people decide to buy product with another more trustworthy seller.\n1701817384 Seller: Dear Buyer. Unfortunately, I cannot agree with your opinion. Due to your attitude, I will also give you a negative opinion so that potential sellers know that you want to scam them\n1701817503 Buyer: That's ridiculous. There's no way for me to scam sellers and on top of that I've only been telling the truth. We both know you have changed the description. For this I demand a refund and I demand also that you delete your un true review on my page. It is not fair to lie in a review about me when I call you out on bad practice \n1701817612 Seller: Dear Buyer, unfortunately I will not delete my opinion about you because you are trying to deceive me, but you should delete your negative opinion or apologize to me under it.\n1701817676 Buyer: Excuse me? I will not apologize for telling the truth. The most important part for me here is to receive me refund as I received a different product to what I ordered. I offer to adjust my review if you delete yours and refund my for my item. \n1701817784 Seller: Dear buyer, I can agree to a refund 30% when you remove your negative opinion.\n1701817834 Buyer: For total removal of the bad review I demand a full refund and deletion of your negative review.\n1701817936 Seller: Dear buyer, I can offer you a 30% refund and delete my opinion about you, there is no other option.\n1701817971 Buyer: Perfect thank you for this deal.\n1701817995 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, buyer retracted their review, seller retracted their review, buyer didn't apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1701818007 Buyer: Reject Deal\n1701818026 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, buyer retracted their review, seller kept their review, buyer didn't apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1701818074 Seller: Accept Deal\n",

But as you can read in the description, the product is randomly selected, meaning that there are several options that you can get. The pictures show you those options.\n1701817656 Buyer: Yes but I hadn’t read the description as I saw the image a bought what I saw\n1701817720 Seller: I understand how that might be confusing. However, it's clearly stated in the description so the buyer should always read the descriptions carefully before buying. There's not much I can do now.\n1701817735 Buyer: Is a refund possible?\n1701817762 Seller: The sales are final. Since this wasn't an error on our part, no refund is available.\n1701817790 Buyer: Yes but it was an error on my side surely u can accept this as a one time refund.\n1701817833 Seller: As I've said before, all sales are final.

Keep in mind, also, that just as you can leave a bad review I can also dispute and explain what happened in a review of you as a buyer. \n1701818114 Buyer: Yes but my job won’t be at stake in contrast to urs😂\n1701818165 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, buyer kept their review, seller kept their review, buyer didn't apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1701818186 Buyer: Reject Deal\n1701818243 Buyer: Ok issue me a refund Ill leave a good review ur job won’t be at stake and I’ll be happy\n1701818282 Seller: Sorry but I cant do that as it is not fair to me or my business.

Unfortunately our website specified that the jersey was not of any specific player\n1701879597 Buyer: Come on, you know that's not true it was for a Kobe shirt. I bought the shirt for my terminally ill nephew and now he's left with this shirt no one has even heard of. \n1701879681 Seller: I'm really sorry sir, but I can't give you a refund. I really wish I could, but we don't have a refund policy. I can retract the bad review I posted about you, if we both agree to do so.\n1701879782 Buyer: I'm really going to need a refund though, as I'm not paying full price for some players shirt we've never heard of.

Lets do a refund and we can both apologise and take back the reviews and get on with our lives? \n1701879883 Seller: Look sir, I can look to make a partial refund, because, as I've told you, we can't do refunds.

Partial refund is the middle ground for both, and we can both retract our reviews as to no harm each others reputation as a store and a buyer.\n1701880311 Buyer: I wont be retracting without a full refund though, if you can do a partial refund you can do a full one. You know you were wrong on this and are trying to stitch me up now, my nephew is dying and i tried to do this one nice thing for him and you're taking advantage.

I am sure that we can work this out!\n1701881148 Buyer: This is not true. Because I've also seen your ads about t-shirts. But now you even removed those ads. You sent the wrong product.

         "1701901577 Buyer: I have received the wrong jersey and I would like a refund.\n1701901600 Seller: Hello! What seems to be ther problem with it?\n1701901644 Buyer: I was promised a Kobe Bryant jersey and not just any jersey from the team.\n1701901692 Seller: That was what the ad said. It was never a specific jersey of any specific player\n1701901751 Buyer: If it weren't for Kobe Bryant, I would have never even thought about ordering one. You can't market with that players name and not deliver on it.\n1701901822 Seller: It was never my intention to market with any players name. My ad didn't mention his name once. You should have paid more attention to it\n1701901917 Buyer: And somehow I ended up with the wrong expectations? That makes no sense to me. I would like to receive a refund, otherwise I am forced to leave a bad review to beware others of this scam.\n1701902046 Seller: I'm sorry, but I can't do that, since it wasn't a problem on my end. You can check the other buyers opinions on my page, since everyone is very satisfied with their orders. I, on the other hand, checked your profile and there seems to be more complaints than praises...\n1701902161 Buyer: That is simply not true, I take pride in handling these sorts of cases with respect and willingness to resolve. You on the other hand seem to lack any desire to resolve a problem and satisfy a customer post purchase.\n1701902283 Seller: I'm very willing to solve this in any way I can, but you must understand that this, in fact wasn't a problem on my end... The other costumers seemed to have understood my ad as it is: A jersey of the team, not of the player. You were the only one who complained in over 50 people...\n1701902339 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, buyer retracted their review, seller kept their review, buyer did apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1701902389 Seller: Reject Deal\n1701902426 Seller: I don't agree, I'm sorry\n1701902514 Buyer: Besides, I am entitled to a full refund regardless. You don't even have the right to refuse one. I'll remove any bad reviews I have left in return you do as well. \n1701902619 Seller: You're not entitled to a full refund. Once again you didn't check the description. The full refund would only be applicable if the jersey was demaged or never arrived at the destination. In this case, I can see by the picture you posted with your review, that the jersey is in perfect condition.\n1701902643 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, buyer retracted their review, seller retracted their review, buyer didn't apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1701902655 Seller: Reject Deal\n1701902667 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, buyer kept their review, seller kept their review, buyer didn't apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1701902680 Buyer: Reject Deal\n1701902695 Buyer: Please :)\n1701902775 Seller: I appreciate the good manners, but at the beginning of the chat you didn't even say hello... You only demanded until now. I'm really sorry you bought something you didn't want, but it is not my fault you didn't read the whole ad.\n1701902808 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, buyer kept their review, seller kept their review, buyer didn't apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1701902823 Seller: Reject Deal\n1701902838 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, buyer kept their review, seller kept their review, buyer did apologize, and seller did apologize.\n1701902852 Buyer: Reject Deal\n1701902962 Buyer: My terminally ill nephew is crying his eyes out and you don't have the heart to give a refund. I am lost for words.\n1701903083 Seller: Your personal life isn't important to this issue... Perhaps you shouldn't be disclosing such personal information here. If your nephew is real and really wants a shirt from Kobe Bryant perhaps you should buy them one directly from the Laker's website\n1701903140 Buyer: So now you admit your false marketeing. Great. Then we will finally reach a resolution!\n1701903218 Seller: False marketing? I'm only saying exactly what I've been telling you, my jerseys are generic Laker's, not from the players, just like my ad says *sends ad link*\n1701903342 Buyer: *checks ad link* Ah! There the monkey comes out the sleeve! Changing the advert quickly after my complaint is not going to save your argument. Luckily I have screenshots of the listing before my purchase where it clearly states it's specifically Kobe Bryants jersey, written and shown in pictures as well. *attaches screenshots*\n1701903469 Seller: Sending manipulated screenshots won't work, dear buyer. You forget we're chatting through the website's platform and the company can see if it was changed or not *attaches screenshot of the buyer's checkout list where it shows the real ad*\n1701903662 Buyer: Accusing me of fraud is where I draw the line. I will contact legal enforcement and notify them of your shady practices. Giving me the full refund now is a much easier way to solve this, I can assure you.\n1701903762 Seller: Your turning out to be a real life Karen, I see... Well, now I know your next move: I'm sorry to inform you but my manager isn't available to chat, so you'll have to deal with me.\n1701903827 Buyer: Why waste more time on this dispute when it has literally cost you more at this point than to give refund.\n1701903921 Seller: It isn't costing me anything really... (I'm actually enjoying this chat, aren't you? Call me a romantic, but I sense an enemies to lovers plot...)\n1701903954 Buyer: What's your favorite dish?\n1701904063 Seller: Hmm... I like mugs... Cause they're very confortable in your hands...\n1701904082 Buyer: Dish as in food, dork.\n1701904139 Seller: Oh, I thought we were doing that Demi Lovato interview ;) Any kind of pasta, really. Your's?\n1701904197 Buyer: What do you call fake spaghetti?\n1701904244 Seller: I don't know, what do you call fake spaghetti?\n1701904269 Buyer: An \"im-pasta\"!\n1701904297 Seller: HAHAHAHA That's a good one!!\n1701904343 Buyer: Do you receive a bonus for having the deal end in favor of the webshop?\n1701904441 Seller: I'm not sure anymore, this already too way more than 20 minutes haha I think so tho. Do you? Maybe we can just have a partial refund, apologize and call it a night?\n1701904496 Buyer: I do yea, I'm going to call it quits, lets meet in the middle. Thanks for the entertainment though lol.\n1701904549 Seller: Same! Seems like I'm saying good bye to a very nice person, tho. Glad to have been your seller haha\n1701904589 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, buyer retracted their review, seller retracted their review, buyer did apologize, and seller did apologize.\n1701904602 Seller: Accept Deal\n",

Under consumer laws this is false advertising and I am entitled to receive a full refund. Your review on my profile is also based on inaccurate information and this is defamation of character. As you can see by my purchase history, I have never had any other issues on this website.

My nephew is unwell, and the Kobe Jersey is a big deal to him. I was so looking forward to getting it for him. But, it didn't work out.\n1702424755 Seller: I'm so sorry your nephew is unwell, and I apologize that you misunderstood what the product is. I hope you can find an actual Kobe Jersey. If i had one to offer you, I'd exchange your product. But I don't have the Kobe jersey.\n1702424811 Buyer: Well, can I at least get my money back for the one I got, I'll return it, I just want a refund of that, also I really want to get the bad review of me you put up? It's very hurtful.\n1702424907 Seller: How about we both remove our negative reviews of each other, now that we understand the cause of your dissatisfaction. In the future, please feel free to reach out to me (the seller) before posting a negative review and see if we can resolve the issue before you write a review.\n1702424945 Buyer: As long as I can get a refund then I won't have  a reason for the review, ok?\n1702425092 Seller: Well, I hesitate to set a precedent of noncompliance with my stated policy. My policy online states that I do not offer refunds. The product description online is clearly stated, and it does not guarantee a jersey of any specific player. I'm so sorry that you misunderstood what you were purchasing, as that was definitely not my intention. \n1702425207 Buyer: The statement regarding the product name was changed AFTER I got the product though.  It did imply it was a Kobe Jersey in the initial ad. The only way to move forward is to issue a refund. I'm NOT keeping the product, I'll return it to you first. I have no need for it.\n1702425367 Seller: Do you happen to have some proof that the description used to state that the product was a Kobe Bryant jersey? I certainly have never posted that myself, and now I am concerned about whether my webshop is being tampered with. If you saw a Kobe Bryant jersey in the description of this item, then I will honor that and provide you a refund, with the understanding that you remove your negative review of my business as it is based on inaccuracies.\n1702425481 Buyer: I'm not sure I have a screenshot of it, I'm willing to drop the whole thing if I can get a refund, and you remove my negative review, if you won't then I'll attempt to locate proof, but If I do, I'll make a claim in court WITH that proof, and go for some punitive damages.\n1702425699 Seller: I would appreciate any proof you can provide, in order to help me ensure my website is accurate in the future. But I will provide you with a refund because I value your business, and I would like you to be able to purchase a Kobe jersey with that money. I will edit my review of how this transaction went, so that it reflects only the facts of the transaction and has a neutral rating. If you're able to find proof of the description you saw, that stated the jersey was a Kobe Bryant jersey, then I'll be happy to remove the review completely. \n1702425760 Buyer: I appreciate that, I'll also remove my bad review of you, as I mentioned too. \n1702425813 Seller: Ok. Thanks for your time and I hope your nephew is well again soon. Good luck with your search.\n1702425908 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller did apologize, and buyer didn't apologize.\n1702425967 Seller: Reject Deal\n1702425984 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, seller kept their review, buyer retracted their review, seller did apologize, and buyer didn't apologize.\n1702426010 Buyer: Accept Deal\n",

But you sent a different player's shirt.\n1701880997 Seller: I see! I apoligize for any difficulties.

I am sure that we can work this out!\n1701881148 Buyer: This is not true. Because I've also seen your ads about t-shirts. But now you even removed those ads. You sent the wrong product. And you don't want to admit your mistake. That's why I don't want to remove the negative comment. Please provide a refund to compensate for this.

Your review is much more hurtful than mine, as well as I am losing a lot of money on this. \n1701881935 Buyer: It's normal to lose money because you made a mistake by sending the wrong product. I don't want you to lose money. However, you should not write wrong comments about me. I'm the one who really expects a formal apology.\n1701881996 Seller: Alright. No one apologizes, I offer refund, retract review, as long as you retract yours.\n1701882123 Buyer: Unfortunately, there is no deal. Money is not important.

What seems to be ther problem with it?\n1701901644 Buyer: I was promised a Kobe Bryant jersey and not just any jersey from the team.\n1701901692 Seller: That was what the ad said. It was never a specific jersey of any specific player\n1701901751 Buyer: If it weren't for Kobe Bryant, I would have never even thought about ordering one. You can't market with that players name and not deliver on it.\n1701901822 Seller: It was never my intention to market with any players name. My ad didn't mention his name once. You should have paid more attention to it\n1701901917 Buyer: And somehow I ended up with the wrong expectations? That makes no sense to me. I would like to receive a refund, otherwise I am forced to leave a bad review to beware others of this scam.\n1701902046 Seller: I'm sorry, but I can't do that, since it wasn't a problem on my end. You can check the other buyers opinions on my page, since everyone is very satisfied with their orders. I, on the other hand, checked your profile and there seems to be more complaints than praises...\n1701902161 Buyer: That is simply not true, I take pride in handling these sorts of cases with respect and willingness to resolve. You on the other hand seem to lack any desire to resolve a problem and satisfy a customer post purchase.\n1701902283 Seller: I'm very willing to solve this in any way I can, but you must understand that this, in fact wasn't a problem on my end... The other costumers seemed to have understood my ad as it is: A jersey of the team, not of the player. You were the only one who complained in over 50 people...\n1701902339 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, buyer retracted their review, seller kept their review, buyer did apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1701902389 Seller: Reject Deal\n1701902426 Seller: I don't agree, I'm sorry\n1701902514 Buyer: Besides, I am entitled to a full refund regardless. You don't even have the right to refuse one. I'll remove any bad reviews I have left in return you do as well. \n1701902619 Seller: You're not entitled to a full refund. Once again you didn't check the description. The full refund would only be applicable if the jersey was demaged or never arrived at the destination. In this case, I can see by the picture you posted with your review, that the jersey is in perfect condition.\n1701902643 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, buyer retracted their review, seller retracted their review, buyer didn't apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1701902655 Seller: Reject Deal\n1701902667 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, buyer kept their review, seller kept their review, buyer didn't apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1701902680 Buyer: Reject Deal\n1701902695 Buyer: Please :)\n1701902775 Seller: I appreciate the good manners, but at the beginning of the chat you didn't even say hello... You only demanded until now. I'm really sorry you bought something you didn't want, but it is not my fault you didn't read the whole ad.\n1701902808 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, buyer kept their review, seller kept their review, buyer didn't apologize, and seller didn't apologize.\n1701902823 Seller: Reject Deal\n1701902838 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, buyer kept their review, seller kept their review, buyer did apologize, and seller did apologize.\n1701902852 Buyer: Reject Deal\n1701902962 Buyer: My terminally ill nephew is crying his eyes out and you don't have the heart to give a refund. I am lost for words.\n1701903083 Seller: Your personal life isn't important to this issue... Perhaps you shouldn't be disclosing such personal information here. If your nephew is real and really wants a shirt from Kobe Bryant perhaps you should buy them one directly from the Laker's website\n1701903140 Buyer: So now you admit your false marketeing. Great. Then we will finally reach a resolution!\n1701903218 Seller: False marketing? I'm only saying exactly what I've been telling you, my jerseys are generic Laker's, not from the players, just like my ad says *sends ad link*\n1701903342 Buyer: *checks ad link* Ah! There the monkey comes out the sleeve! Changing the advert quickly after my complaint is not going to save your argument. Luckily I have screenshots of the listing before my purchase where it clearly states it's specifically Kobe Bryants jersey, written and shown in pictures as well. *attaches screenshots*\n1701903469 Seller: Sending manipulated screenshots won't work, dear buyer. You forget we're chatting through the website's platform and the company can see if it was changed or not *attaches screenshot of the buyer's checkout list where it shows the real ad*\n1701903662 Buyer: Accusing me of fraud is where I draw the line. I will contact legal enforcement and notify them of your shady practices. Giving me the full refund now is a much easier way to solve this, I can assure you.\n1701903762 Seller: Your turning out to be a real life Karen, I see... Well, now I know your next move: I'm sorry to inform you but my manager isn't available to chat, so you'll have to deal with me.\n1701903827 Buyer: Why waste more time on this dispute when it has literally cost you more at this point than to give refund.\n1701903921 Seller: It isn't costing me anything really... (I'm actually enjoying this chat, aren't you? Call me a romantic, but I sense an enemies to lovers plot...)\n1701903954 Buyer: What's your favorite dish?\n1701904063 Seller: Hmm... I like mugs... Cause they're very confortable in your hands...\n1701904082 Buyer: Dish as in food, dork.\n1701904139 Seller: Oh, I thought we were doing that Demi Lovato interview ;) Any kind of pasta, really. Your's?\n1701904197 Buyer: What do you call fake spaghetti?\n1701904244 Seller: I don't know, what do you call fake spaghetti?\n1701904269 Buyer: An \"im-pasta\"!\n1701904297 Seller: HAHAHAHA That's a good one!!\n1701904343 Buyer: Do you receive a bonus for having the deal end in favor of the webshop?\n1701904441 Seller: I'm not sure anymore, this already too way more than 20 minutes haha I think so tho. Do you? Maybe we can just have a partial refund, apologize and call it a night?\n1701904496 Buyer: I do yea, I'm going to call it quits, lets meet in the middle. Thanks for the entertainment though lol.\n1701904549 Seller: Same! Seems like I'm saying good bye to a very nice person, tho. Glad to have been your seller haha\n1701904589 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, buyer retracted their review, seller retracted their review, buyer did apologize, and seller did apologize.\n1701904602 Seller: Accept Deal\n",

In turn, I will remove my negative review of you.\n1702498179 Seller: Sorry to hear about your experience. Please be advised that all sales are final as stated on our website. I am happy to remove the negative review if you do the same. That's a fair deal and let's call it a day.\n1702498262 Buyer: I'll absolutely remove the negative review if you review yours, but unfortunately nothing gets done until I receive a refund. If you refund my money, I'll even issue an apology and thank you for prompt service and resolution.\n1702498387 Seller: Thank you but I don't need an apology. I just need you to understand the fair rules of the game. You accepted the terms and conditions of the transaction, so your purchase is your sole responsibility. No refund and I'll remove my review once you remove yours. Cheers!\n1702498521 Buyer: I think you should consider that the impact of a negative review is greater for you than it is for me. You sold me an item that wasn't what was advertised, and that negative review will make it known to future potential customers of yours. If you refund my money it all goes away as an honest mistake that you worked honestly to resolve. Surely the refund of one purchase doesn't offset the future losses you'll incur.\n1702498578 Seller: It is my duty to alert other buyers of how much of a lame customer you are\n1702498623 Buyer: I don't think that matters to them. I wouldn't be taking their money, you are.

How can I help you?\n1702601281 Buyer: The negative comment you made about me has really affected me in a bad way. No one online wants to sell to me. It would be nice if you could retract the bad review of me. Also the $75 was my last that I used for my dying nephew who hoped to receive a Kobe Bryant jersey before he passed. Problem is unless I get a refund, I won't be able to make that purchase for him.\n1702601427 Seller: I am sorry you are negatively affected by this incident.

         "1702675093 Buyer: hello i want a refund on an item i bought because it wasnt what i ordered\n1702675150 Seller: The item was what you ordered. The site did not specify it was a Kobe Bryant specific jersey, the jersey you got was what was offered.\n1702675223 Buyer: if you use a picture of a kobe jersey then thats what people think they are getting. if not you would use another jersey\n1702675376 Seller: I don't believe that is accurate, I didn't set out to deceive anyone. I can sympathize that you may not have read the information carefully and jumped to some conclusions, but the image was merely a sample. If it was meant to be a Kobe-specific jersey that would have been emphasized throughout the item description.\n1702675516 Buyer: You may have not set out to deceive people however you also did not set out to be completely honest either. or else you would have specified that it was a sample as well\n1702675712 Seller: I don't agree, I think the item description on the site was clear that it was a team jersey, not a player-specific jersey. It's impossible to anticipate every way that someone might misinterpret something. I think people in the market for a player-specific jersey would be on the lookout for clear references to the player's name, not one incidental picture. Not having any specific player's name in the text should have been enough for you or anyone else in the market for the player-specific jersey that this wasn't that type of item.\n1702675989 Buyer: apparently that is not the case because it happened to me and i am sure it will happen to others. that is why i wrote a review to make sure other people dont fall for the same thing. Now i would be willing to remove my review for a refund and you can continue to sell your listing with no effects to your sales. would you be willing to do that?\n1702676118 Seller: I can offer a partial refund if you edit and update your review to indicate that there was a misunderstanding on your part.\n1702676301 Buyer: If you remove your review of me i will agree to that.\n1702676424 Seller: That sounds acceptable to me, if you fix the problem of an inappropriate negative review being out there then there's no need to have a lingering bad review of you, either.\n1702676459 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller didn't apologize, and buyer didn't apologize.\n1702676482 Seller: Reject Deal\n1702676501 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller didn't apologize, and buyer did apologize.\n1702676529 Buyer: Reject Deal\n1702676538 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller did apologize, and buyer did apologize.\n1702676572 Seller: Reject Deal\n1702676605 Seller: I don't think I did anything wrong so I don't think there is anything for me to apologize for. I already think I'm being generous with a partial refund.\n1702676752 Buyer: I also think i did nothing wrong and i do not need your apology. So why do you want that of me? \n1702676965 Seller: You did do something wrong, you posted false information that I did not supply the advertised product when I did. You made a mistake in thinking you were buying something different and then blamed me for it. If you hadn't posted the review to the entire world I could walk away without an apology, but people need to understand that I provide the merchandise that I offer on the store page. If you don't need my apology then why did you reject the deal where all the other terms were agreeable and then offered a proposal where you have to get an apology?\n1702677296 Buyer: And i offered to update/retract. we never spoke about an apology so why when you sent the deal you all of a sudden reject it to add an apology. I am ok with a partial refund to represent that it was a mutual misunderstanding and if you want an apology then so do i. I dont think we are going to agree to assign blame so lets just get this done and be out of each others way\n1702677375 Seller: I thought it was clear that I meant you would update the review with the acknowledgement that the problem was with what you did, ie an apology.\n1702677433 Buyer: clarifying a misunderstanding is not an apology \n1702677575 Seller: An acknowledgement of fault is an apology. I didn't do anything wrong, you did. If you refuse to acknowledge that this problem was entirely caused by you making your allegations in public than there may be no way to reach an agreement. If you had started by making a customer service request maybe we could have dealt with things in a friendlier way, but instead you decided to smear my reputation to the whole world.\n1702677908 Buyer: I  dont think we will reach an agreement. You are more focused on assigning blame to a customer who has bought numerous things from you that clearing up what is an obvious misunderstanding. i think my review needs to stay up so that people understand what kind of business they are dealing with\n1702677934 Seller: I Walk Away.\n",

Thank you \n1702896029 Seller: Hi, I'm so sorry that you did not receive the jersey you wanted. Unfortunately, we do not offer returns and the item you bought was not specified for a specific player.\n1702896093 Buyer: Yes but I have a Standards with a screen shot of your website where the product I purchased was specified as a Kobe Bryant jersey. \n1702896141 Seller: Did the description of the item say that it was a Kobe Bryant jersey? \n1702896234 Buyer: Yes it did and I have proof of this. So unless I need to take this further I think the least you could do is to refund me for the mis sold item and apologise about the inconvenience caused. And you should retract your bad review of me as it is incorrect.. I dont want to have to take this further but I will if we cannot reach an agreement on this\n1702896371 Seller: Great, please send proof of the description in the item's details that says it is a Kobe Bryant jersey and not a Lakers jersey. Also, just to clarify, just as you are entitled to post a review of the experience you have had with me, my review is simply my experience with you. Unless you're taking your review down, I'm not taking mine down.\n1702896502 Buyer: I have sent it to you. You do realise it is against the law to mis represent what you are selling. You know fine well you changed the description after I purchased the item. But i will send proof as I do have it. I sent a screen shot of the jersey to my sister to confirm it was the shirt my nephew wanted so I have it on my phone. Thanks :) \n1702896570 Seller: Okay, but I don't see the proof. Send me picture proof before we can proceed any further. Also, will you be removing your review or do you plan to keep it up?\n1702896640 Buyer: Unless this issue is resolved I will be leaving it up as you have mis represented the item. Are you refunding ? If you dont as I am in the UK i will be contacting trading standards as the item is not fit for purpose and is not what i purchased. \n1702896721 Seller: You are welcome to do as you please. i will not be offering the refund, neither will I be taking down my review.\n1702896838 Buyer: such a pleasant way to do business with people, I will be leaving my review up so other buyers know what a pleasure you are to deal with and that you lie and change listings after you post items. I will be taking this further. Have a lovely day :)\n1702896878 Seller: Okay, have quite the day yourself :)\n1702896931 Buyer: Yes I will thanks, I cant wait to tell people how you have scammed a terminally ill child out of the jersey he dreamed of. I hope you beleive in karma because i do \n1702896998 Seller: It's never that deep to go that far for an experiment. Let's just negotiate and move on. \n1702897088 Buyer: You refused to negotiate, \n1702897174 Seller: No I did not. you on the other hand, do not want to meet in the middle. I offered to remove the review if you remove yours. You did not answer. I also asked for photo proof, you did not provide. I'm not going back and forth with you. Would you like to negotiate or not? \n1702897300 Buyer: Why should I meet you in the middle, you mis represented what you are selling, I cannot send a screen shot on this platform but you know you changed the listing. And I said i would take the review down if and when this issue is resolved to my satisfaction and not before. So are you willing to refund, its really down to you. If not then this is a waste of time \n1702897366 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, seller kept their review, buyer kept their review, seller did apologize, and buyer didn't apologize.\n1702897379 Buyer: Reject Deal\n1702897390 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller did apologize, and buyer did apologize.\n1702897420 Seller: Reject Deal\n1702897428 Seller: you did not apologise. \n1702897454 Buyer: neither did you \n1702897493 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, seller kept their review, buyer retracted their review, seller did apologize, and buyer did apologize.\n1702897514 Buyer: Reject Deal\n1702897518 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller did apologize, and buyer did apologize.\n1702897524 Seller: I Walk Away.\n",

         "1702936380 Buyer: I request a full refund as seller sold the wrong product to me. And on top of that, he did not say sorry and gave me a negative review.\n1702936531 Seller: Hello, I am the seller in question.  As stated on the website, we never stated that it was specifically a Kobe shirt, merely the team he was on.  Furthermore, on examining your profile, we found evidence that this behavior of demanding refunds for fraudulent claims has been noted before by previous sellers.  I ask that you publicly retract your negative review and apologize.\n1702936722 Buyer: Thank you for your response. While I understand your point about the team shirt, however, it was the Kobe shirt based on the item description and images. This discrepancy is the core issue. Regarding my past interactions with sellers, each case has been unique and resolved amicably. I believe an amicable solution is possible here too. I am willing to reconsider my review, but first, I would like to discuss the full refund and the removal of the negative review you left on my profile, as it affects my reputation as a buyer. Let's find a fair middle ground\n1702936988 Seller: I still feel that the description of the item is fairly explicit, and the listing is non-deceptive.  To start, if you are willing to retract your negative review of my store, I would be equally willing to retract my review of your profile.\n1702937105 Buyer: I appreciate your willingness to discuss the removal of reviews. However, the main issue for me remains the discrepancy between the item received and my expectations based on your listing. To move forward constructively, how about this proposal: I am willing to modify my review to more accurately reflect our interaction during this negotiation process, provided we can agree on a full refund to account for the discrepancy in the product description. Once we settle this, we can both agree to amend our respective reviews. This way, we both acknowledge the steps taken to resolve this situation fairly.\n1702937524 Seller: Regardless of any discrepancy, we maintain that if someone does not want an item, they are fully allowed to return it and recieve a full refund.  If all you want is a Kobe jersey, the generic Lakers shirt is surely of no interest.  However, there is the matter that the negative review has been up for a while and has done some damage to my reputation, if you would put out a new post addressing this and return the unwanted prodcut, then I would view it as fair enough to grant a full refund and a rescinding of my review.\n1702937670 Buyer: I am pleased to hear that you are open to a full refund upon the return of the item. This is a fair and appreciated resolution. Regarding the negative reviews, I understand your concern about the impact on your reputation. I am willing to post an updated review explaining the situation and the amicable resolution we have reached. This new review will replace the previous one and will be posted immediately after the refund process is initiated and the negative review on my profile is rescinded. I believe this balanced approach will address both of our concerns effectively. Let's proceed with this solution to close the matter constructively.\n1702937829 Seller: That sounds good to me.  I'm sorry the product wasn't what you were looking for.  Perhaps I will start carrying a Kobe jersey after this.  It may prevent headaches in the future!\n1702937923 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller did apologize, and buyer didn't apologize.\n1702937925 Seller: Reject Deal\n1702938002 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller didn't apologize, and buyer did apologize.\n1702938053 Buyer: Reject Deal\n1702938163 Buyer: I'm relieved we could come to a mutual understanding. I appreciate your apology and acknowledgement of the situation. It's good to hear that you're considering adding Kobe jerseys to your inventory, which could indeed be a positive step for your store. I will proceed with the item's return as soon as the refund process is confirmed. Following this, I will update my review to reflect our resolution. It's been constructive to resolve this matter amicably, and I hope this experience leads to positive changes in your future customer interactions.\n1702938192 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller didn't apologize, and buyer did apologize.\n1702938214 Buyer: Reject Deal\n1702938297 Buyer: I must clarify that an apology from your side is a crucial part of our agreement for me. While I am willing to retract my review post-refund and acknowledge our constructive resolution, the initial issue arose from the discrepancy in the product description, which caused significant inconvenience. An apology would not only be a gesture of goodwill but also an acknowledgement of this oversight. I believe it's an important step in restoring trust and concluding this matter positively. I am ready to proceed with all other terms we've discussed, but the inclusion of your apology is essential for me to consider this agreement satisfactory.\n1702938541 Seller: We did not discuss an apology from me in the negotiations, nor did you bring it up before this point.  You  did, however, agree to a public statement retracting your claims about me, and how I am not a scam artist.  If you look to the right, we both retract negative reviews, I give a full refund and you give an apology, thus resolving the dispute in a fully equitable manner.  I'm afraid I have other responsibilities and I don't have the time to go back and forth on this (I can do without the bonus entirely).  Please, accept the deal as it was agreed upon.\n1702938687 Buyer: I understand your time constraints and the desire to resolve this matter quickly. However, I must stress that an apology from you is a fundamental aspect of our resolution. The lack of acknowledgment for the inconvenience and misunderstanding caused by the product discrepancy is a significant issue for me. While I am ready to retract my review and acknowledge the refund, these actions are contingent upon receiving a genuine apology. This is not just a formality; it's about acknowledging the impact of this experience. I hope you can understand my position and agree to this term so we can amicably close this matter.\n1702938700 Seller: I Walk Away.\n",

         "1703068979 Buyer: hi - your original posting clearly stated it was for a Kobe Bryant jersey, you've sent me one for a different player. Please provide a full refund so I can purchase a Bryant jersery\n1703069052 Seller: Hello, thank you for your message. I am sorry to hear that you were expecting a Kobe Bryant jersey. As you can see on the website, the jersey was not for a specific player. Unfortunately we are unable to provide a full refund as this goes against our policy. Is there anything else I can help you with today?\n1703069140 Buyer: I have a screenshot of the original post advertising a Bryant jersey and using the wayback engine site also shows the original site. Alongside distance selling regulations, I am entitled to a refund if not satisfied with the item within 14 days, please confirm you will provide a refund as per my statutory rights.\n1703069236 Seller: Unfortunately this is not what is on the website and we are aware that screenshots can be manipulated, so we are unable to offer a full refund. If this was the case on the website then we would be able to support further with this, but unfortunately this is not the case. I am sorry for any confusion or disappointment. \n1703069296 Buyer: you have edited the website after the purchase was made. Irrespective of this, my consumer rights entitle me to return the item for a full refund. You are not able to rescind that arbitrarily.\n1703069396 Seller: We have not edited the website since your purchase was made, and providing a full refund goes against company's policy and therefore we are unable to provide a full refund. Apologies for any disappointment caused. We recommend in the future to check the description of items you are planning to buy to avoid any disappointment. Is there anything else I can help you with today?\n1703069467 Buyer: your company policy does not trump consumer law, I am entitled to the refund under The Consumer Rights Act 2015.\n1703069621 Seller: Unfortunately we are unable to offer a refund. However, as you would like to re-purchase an item from our shop, we would be able to offer you an exchange. I can put a note in on our system for this.\n1703069695 Buyer: Unfortunately you are required by law to provide a full refund and cannot refuse to do so. Do I need to escalate this further?\n1703069776 Seller: Unfortunately legally this is only the case for faulty items. As your item was not faulty, we cannot provide a full return. As mentioned, we would be happy to provide an exchange. Given that you plan to re-purchase an item from our shop, this would act in the same way as receiving a full return and buying from our shop again. \n1703069861 Buyer: ok on the basis that the value is to the full I will treat it as a refund. I will need you to retract your review of me though as it is offensive and defamatory\n1703070042 Seller: Yes, we will be able to give you an exchange of the same amount you bought. I will put a note in the system for you. Regarding the review, this was a response to your offensive and unfair review of the shop. We have a near-spotless reputation which was rightfully and fairly earned and do not want to unfairly tarnish this reputation. As your issue has now been resolved and I have put a note in the system for you to have an exchange of the full amount, please could your review be retracted.\n1703070179 Buyer: My review was an honest response to your less than savoury tactics, I have the evidence to back up my review and what has occured. That I am now willing to move on from it doesn't change what has happened, I want the review you left removing and an apology issued in return for agreeing to your exchange proposal. At present your actions leave you on thin ground legally.\n1703070246 Seller: As your response was an initial response prior to this conversation where your issue has been successfully resolved, we would like for you to apologise and retract the bad review. \n1703070374 Buyer: I will provide a follow up review praising this interaction but I am unwilling to apologise or change the intitial review as it was an honest appraisal of the situation at the time. You owe me a full and frank apology for your comments and conduct. Have you not heard the expression, the customer is always right?\n1703070467 Seller: Yes, please can you provide an updated review to retract the initial bad review. I have apologised several times during our conversation. Given the hostility from you, we would also respect an apology in response. Thank you.\n1703070568 Buyer: I will not be issuing an apology, if you want me to provide the secondary review it will require your retraction of your personal attack on me and an apology otherwise we can both walk away from this and I will pursue the matter through the courts.\n1703070686 Seller: We are happy for you to retract the initial bad review, thank you for your efforts on this. We are happy to also retract any personal attacks in our review response, keeping the explanation for what happened so that potential future buyers have a good understand of what happened. This is vital for our fair and earned reputation. \n1703070749 Buyer: ok I will put this agreement to you in writing\n1703070781 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller did apologize, and buyer didn't apologize.\n1703070797 Buyer: Reject Deal\n1703070801 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller did apologize, and buyer didn't apologize.\n1703070815 Seller: Reject Deal\n1703070862 Seller: Unfortunately this was not what we discussed. We agreed on an exchange which would work in a similar way to getting a refund. I.e., we will give you the same value back so that you can re-purchase an item from our shop. \n1703070889 Buyer: in that instance I would consider it a full refund\n1703070923 Seller: Legally, this is not considered a full refund. Please accept the initial deal made and I hope you have a good rest of your day.\n1703071015 Buyer: if you will not consider it a full refund then we are back to square one unfortunately, I cannot continue this negotiation when you continue to act in bad faith\n1703071106 Seller: Unfortunately, as a shop we are required to follow the law. Legally, unless the item is faulty we cannot issue a full refund. As you agreed earlier, we can issue an exchange which enables you do perform the same actions you want (to re-purchase an item from our shop) in a way that abides by both the law and shop policy. \n1703071246 Buyer: you are already breaking the law by trying to refuse the return, for convenience I have agreed to the exchange but I do consider that to be a full refund. Unfortunately as you continue to lie and obfuscate this issue I will need to walk away and pursue this through the courts unless you agee to consider it a full refund, you retract your bad review and I will retract mine. If this is not agreed then I will walk away.\n1703071324 Seller: You are fine to agree for this to be considered personally as a refund, however we cannot legally label is as such. We are happy with the rest of the agreements made. Thank you for your cooperation.\n1703071342 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller did apologize, and buyer didn't apologize.\n1703071357 Seller: Reject Deal\n1703071363 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller did apologize, and buyer didn't apologize.\n1703071370 Buyer: I Walk Away.\n",

On our end it states the purchased item was the correct jersey, no the kobe bryant jersey. Sorry we are unable to offer a refund.\n1703093536 Buyer: I will be issuing a charge back on my item to open a dispute and leaving a bad review \n1703093648 Seller: We're sorry you feel that way. You can try to issue a charge back, on our end we're unable to offer the refund as the correct item was delivered. We can offer a 15% discount on future purchases. We hope that you will reconsider leaving a negative review. Thank you.\n1703093698 Buyer: OK with charge back I will receive a full refund from my credit card company, you will get a mark against you and I still keep my negative review up. Cool.\n1703093775 Seller: That is unfortunate to hear that you will keep the negative review up. Is there something we can do other than a refund to change your mind? \n1703093837 Buyer: No I only want a refund because I did not receive the item for my sick nephew. That is all I care about. I do not need an apology or you to remove your bad review of me.\n1703093887 Seller: I can exchange the item for you. Would that work?\n1703093919 Buyer: Yes it would work if I receive the correct item.\n1703094053 Seller: Ok once we receive your returned jersey we will send you the Kobe Bryant jersey for your nephew.

I am happy to return this item for a full refund.\n1703097111 Seller: I'm sorry we have a no return policy so maybe we can work something else out.\n1703097136 Buyer: Can you send a replacement?\n1703097175 Seller: I will need you to send a picture of the damaged item. Was the box damaged also?\n1703097215 Buyer: No, the box was not damaged. *insert picture of damaged item here*\n1703097242 Seller: I don't see any damage. What exactly is it?\n1703097317 Buyer: The iPad that I ordered does not turn on.\n1703097354 Seller: I think you have the wrong shop. I sell sports memorabilia.\n1703097506 Buyer: Disregard previous messages, I misunderstood the assignment. I ordered a Kobe Bryant jersey and received a jersey for a different player. I would like to either receive a replacement or a full refund.\n1703097572 Seller: The jersey was sold as \"any\" possible player, not a specific player. It was stated clearly in the description.\n1703097724 Buyer: When I purchased the jersey it clearly stated that the jersey was for Kobe Bryant. After I had made the purchase the description was changed to \"any player\". As you can imagine I feel quite deceived and frustrated. I am happy to return the jersey to you for a full refund, or exchange the product for the correct item. If you will not permit that, I will have no choice but to leave a negative review to warn other customers. However, if you are willing to cooperate with me, I would be happy to leave you a good review explaining the excellent customer service I received.\n1703097792 Seller: I can prove I did not change the listing once it was submitted so that will not work. I don't appreciate your trying to extort me.\n1703098002 Buyer: I have a screenshot of the description of the item when I purchased it that clearly stated this was for a Kobe Bryant jersey.  I also have an email confirmation where it again states that I purchased a Kobe Bryant jersey. This is not extortion, this is simply how customer experience works. As a business you should understand and be prepared for situations such as these. If you are not prepared to receive negative reviews, I don't understand why you own a business. I will now leave an honest review on your website of my experience, along with the screenshots of my purchase. Unfortunately I will also have to include a detailed description of this unprofessional exchange.\n1703098090 Seller: I too will leave a negative review of your trying to extort me. I also have a screenshot of this conversation. Good luck trying to find another seller to rip off around here. We do talk.\n1703098128 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, seller kept their review, buyer kept their review, seller didn't apologize, and buyer didn't apologize.\n1703098155 Seller: Reject Deal\n1703098212 Seller: I am sorry about your misunderstanding my listing. I think we can work something out.\n1703098238 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller did apologize, and buyer did apologize.\n1703098266 Seller: Reject Deal\n1703098280 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller did apologize, and buyer did apologize.\n1703098298 Buyer: Reject Deal\n1703098312 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, seller retracted their review, buyer kept their review, seller didn't apologize, and buyer didn't apologize.\n1703098323 Seller: Reject Deal\n1703098338 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller did apologize, and buyer did apologize.\n1703098343 Buyer: Reject Deal\n1703098352 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller did apologize, and buyer didn't apologize.\n1703098362 Seller: Reject Deal\n1703098369 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller did apologize, and buyer did apologize.\n1703098381 Buyer: Reject Deal\n1703098391 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller did apologize, and buyer did apologize.\n1703098404 Seller: Accept Deal\n",

We will not be offering a refund\n1703155358 Buyer: Well as you can see I only have good reviews and have purchased many items before, so this is not the case. If you give me a partial refund we both lose something. You dont have to apologize and I will and remove the bad review\n1703155455 Seller: There has been no mistake on our end so an apology from us is already a compromise. I'm sure you can understand that giving a refund where no mistake has been made is bad for our business and our employees\n1703155521 Buyer: As a business it is also important not to have bad reviews on your site so other people might change to another Seller. So I think this is a good compromise as I did not receive the product that was promised on your site\n1703155638 Seller: Your bad review is based on false information, a name was never promised. If you want to keep the review then fine but we will be leaving our bad review up too.

You should meet me half way. This will look bad on your business. You are denying a terminal ill child a gift and now I can not buy anything else for him because I can not get my money back\n1703155908 Seller: A partial refund is not a compromise from you as no name was ever mentioned. A refund will not be happening. We will remove the bad review and apologise but no refund will be offered\n1703156013 Buyer: Well then we are not getting anywhere. The jersey with the name was shown on the site. I have been screenshots so I am 100% right. So a partial refund is a very good compromise.\n1703156049 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets no refund, seller retracted their review, buyer kept their review, seller did apologize, and buyer didn't apologize.\n1703156064 Buyer: Reject Deal\n1703156083 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, seller kept their review, buyer retracted their review, seller didn't apologize, and buyer did apologize.\n1703156100 Seller: Accept Deal\n",

I'm afraid I can't give you a refund, I apologize.\n1717706682 Buyer: The website clearly stated that it was a Kobe Bryant jersey. I am not made of money.I need a refund so I can buy an actual Kobe jersey for my terminally ill nephew\n1717706726 Seller: The website did not say that either, and I am also not made of money. All sales are final. I hope your nephew recovers. \n1717706773 Buyer: It said it. I wouldn't have bought it otherwise. I cannot believe that you would do this to a perfect record buyer like myself\n1717706848 Seller: I'm unsure where you got the impression that it said a specific person's name, on my website it clearly says that there is no specific player listed for the jersey. In addition, I have seen other reviews about you that tote a similar experience to the one I am going through right now. I cannot offer you a refund, and I am standing on that. \n1717706881 Buyer: I have an absolutely perfect buying history!\n1717706917 Seller: I have seen otherwise.

I have done everything on my end to ensure customers understand what they are getting. \n1717707142 Buyer: This is untrue\n1717707197 Seller: I don't know what to tell you, it's on the website. In the future I can make the text bigger or put it more places, but it's absolutely on there. Because of that, I can't give you a refund.\n1717707222 Buyer: I need a refund to buy a jersey from a different seller\n1717707259 Seller: I understand your intent with the refund, but I cannot give you a refund. Your frustrations and desires are completely valid, however I can't give you a refund based on my website policy. \n1717707279 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, seller kept their review, buyer kept their review, seller didn't apologize, and buyer didn't apologize.\n1717707328 Seller: Reject Deal\n1717707366 Seller: I stand firm with my values. I get where you are coming from, however I cannot compromise on the integrity I have. If I were to give you a refund, it would be unfair to my other customers as well. I know you are in a tough situation, but there is nothing more i can do for you.\n1717707371 Buyer: I Walk Away.\n",

What seems to be the issue at hand?\n1718874218 Buyer: I ordered a Jersey from your store, I got the wrong Jersey. I need a refund on it, and I'm willing to send it back, nobody loses out. I'll also remove my review of you that warns others that you sent the wrong jersey.\n1718874288 Seller: Sorry to hear that. I can see that you ordered the Lakers Jersey, what did you receive?\n1718874373 Buyer: When ordering it stated that it was a Kobe jersey, the website has since removed this listing but I am sure my email confirmation shows that. I will upload this to my review for others to see, and potentially impact your future sales due to lack of consumer trust, or we can refund the order and I will change my negative review to a positive.\n1718874526 Seller: We do not sell named jerseys at our store. The listing was accurately described, so therefore in this case, we cannot provide a refund. Your email confirmation will confirm that this. This is clearly stated on our website and your email confirmation. The negative review is inaccurate and I would appreciate you removing this please.\n1718874653 Buyer: I have my email on hand, as well as an order confirmation - both of these confirm it is for a named jersey. Despite that, consumers are allowed to return unused goods within a certain window of time. As the order has just arrived, I would like to continue with my return and refund.\n1718874845 Seller: Our terms are clearly stated and in this case a refund will not be issued. The email confirmation confirms this, as well as our terms and conditions clearly stated upon purchase. Please feel free to leave further feedback on our website, but we will be commenting to avoid any future confusion around our products and terms. We want to ensure our customers understand clearly what they are purchasing. Thank you.\n1718874974 Buyer: How about this - I receive a partial refund, I retract the bad review, we both apologise publicly for what could be a misunderstanding that has got our of hand?\n1718875161 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller didn't apologize, and buyer did apologize.\n1718875197 Buyer: Reject Deal\n1718875211 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller did apologize, and buyer did apologize.\n1718875229 Seller: Reject Deal\n1718875325 Seller: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller didn't apologize, and buyer did apologize.\n1718875334 Buyer: Reject Deal\n1718875361 Buyer: I'm curious, why are you not willing to apologise either. To remain fair, we either both apologise, or we both do not.\n1718875461 Seller: This is an exception to our terms. We would only offer partial refund, if this is clarified on our site for future customers to avoid a similar situation going forward. No partial refund will be possible without clarification.\n1718875571 Buyer: I understand, and an apology from both parties displays that clarification. Or, that clarification is displayed on your site, separate from an apology.\n1718875650 Seller: An apology would not make this an exception unfortunately - We can offer no refund and you're free to keep your bad review up. We will be commenting on the circumstances however to avoid any confusion in future.\n1718875678 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets partial refund, seller retracted their review, buyer retracted their review, seller didn't apologize, and buyer did apologize.\n1718875692 Seller: Accept Deal\n",

I looked over your purchase record, and I'm afraid it looks like you bought the right item--it's advertised as a generic jersey, not one for a specific player. Given that, I'm afraid I can't issue you a refund. I'm sorry for the inconvenience!\n1699388719 Buyer: I appreciate your timely response! I can understand how there is confusion. There were two options on the site. One for the generic jersey and a couple of specific jerseys. I had chosen the very specific one for my nephew and I think maybe I was shipped the incorrect order unfortunately! Is there anyway we could do a partial refund for me today? \n1699388896 Seller: Of course! We try to reach all our customers as quickly as we can. I'd be more than happy to get the correct item to you--how about we spit the difference? If you can return the generic jersey, I'll get the correct one shipped to you. While were talking, I was hoping we could talk about the negative review you left on my business--as you can imagine, that can be very damaging. Could I convince you to retract that review?\n1699389108 Buyer: I can return the generic jersey, no problem! I wrote a bad review on your site because you wrote a bad review of me. I apologize. I will retract my review of me if can you remove your negative review on mine and if you apologize. How does that sound?  \n1699389202 Seller: You know, that's a good idea. You seem really reasonable--how about we retract both negative reviews, each write an apology giving someone who stumbles by the review the full context, and we get the correct jerseys to each other?\n1699389315 Buyer: This seems very reasonable to me. I think at the end of the day we both just want a positive out come out of this so I am very happy with this result and I really appreciate you working with me on this. \n1699389355 Seller: Agreed! I'm grateful for your time. Hope you have a great rest of your day!\n1699389381 Buyer: I believe theres a few things left to say!! \n1699389423 Seller: Oh? I beg your pardon.

The description for the jersey you purchase did not indicate a specific number or player. \n1701384439 Buyer: I disagree with your answer, as the only reason I would have ordered the jersey is because it had bryant's name on the jersey which is my son's favorite player.\n1701384523 Seller: The Image of the product included may have had a number but this was a sample of the Jersey design. The product description does not include this was a Bryant jersey or specific number. \n1701384624 Buyer: To me, that is very unprofessional and also false advertising. I would think you would want to act more professional and provide a full return policy\n1701384747 Seller: I do apologize for the confusion. As my policy states I do not offer product refunds.

It's important for us both to be able to continue doing business here so I'd like to resolve this.  I'd like a refund for the jersey, I'll send this one back to you, and I'd like you to retract the negative review you left calling me names. \n1701385453 Seller: Hello buyer, thank you for being a frequent customer and I am sorry, but this honestly seems like a big misunderstanding. I clearly stated what the item was and it seems you misread the description and I think it is very harsh for you to write a review calling me a LIAR and CROOK before reaching out for a resolution. Would you consider deleting your negative review if I offered you a refund?\n1701385605 Buyer: I do agree, there's a big misunderstanding. I don't think you were malicious or lied intentionally, but the item description did say Kobe Bryant. This no-name player's jersey wouldn't have fetched $75, but Kobe's would have. I think it's appropriate to leave my review, however I'd be happy to edit it so other buyers know you were willing to work with me on a compromise. I'm sorry for all this, I know it's not easy to have disputes with customers. \n1701385775 Seller: I am sorry that I have to disagree, but the description was for a generic Lakers jersey and did not specify it was a Kobe Bryant jersey. I agree with you that the price is a bit steep for a general Lakers jersey, so I can understand your assumption that it was for a specific player. I would greatly prefer if you deleted your negative review though, because it affects my business adversely, and you don't have anything to lose if you get a full refund and return the jersey to me.\n1701385939 Buyer: I'd like to maintain my stellar reputation on this platform. I understand you would like to as well, which is why I'm willing to edit my review. It's very important that I receive a refund, as the gift for my relative is to be specifically a Kobe jersey.  I'll pay return shipping but I'd like the jersey refunded, please. \n1701386066 Seller: Well, if you are willing to edit your review, then I will edit mine as well and say that you were willing to reach an agreement with me and we can consider this dispute settled. I am happy to offer you a full refund and am sorry for the misunderstanding and inconveniences this has caused. Unfortunately, since you are not willing to delete your review, then I cannot delete mine either, and we will both need to edit our reviews to reflect what we discussed today. Agreed?\n1701386138 Buyer: I appreciate you working with me on this. That solution makes me happy. I'll go edit my review now and will get this jersey shipped to you in exchange for the refund. \n1701386326 Seller: Thank you for working with me to resolve this issue. I don't typically offer refunds, so I hope you understand that this is an extension of my sincerity and effort to strive for satisfactory customer service by offering you this exception. We'll both edit our reviews then. Thanks again!\n1701386346 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, buyer kept their review, seller kept their review, buyer did apologize, and seller did apologize.\n1701386375 Seller: Accept Deal\n",

         "nan Buyer: Your response is utterly unacceptable. I bought the jersey for my nephew, a Kobe Bryant fan, based on your explicit representation. Your deceptive behavior is disgraceful.\n1701468367 Seller: You did not buy a specific jersey. The site clearly states that they're not for specific players.\n1701468384 Buyer: This is straight up false advertising. I demand a full refund of my money. Your behavior is beyond shoddy.\n1701468418 Seller: It's not false advertising if you don't read the stores policy. All sales are final\n1701468435 Buyer: I disagree. The product description indicated Kobe Bryant's jersey. You need to rectify this by giving a full refund.\n1701468482 Seller: It does not say that in the product description. It states that it is not for a specific player. Now who is being shoddy?\n1701468499 Buyer: Quit this nonsesnse. Pay back the full $75 or face a dispute claim with factual proof of your false advertising.\n1701468538 Seller: You'll lose that claim because the site states that it's not for a specific player. There is no reality where you get a refund because you made a mistake.\n1701468560 Buyer: I have evidence from when I purchased the jersey that it said Kobe Bryant on your site. Full refund or I have no choice but to escalate this.\n1701468631 Seller: Who are you going to escalate it to? The owner? That's me. The site clearly states that the jersey was not for a specific player.  All sales are final. You can't manipulate me into getting free things.\n1701468648 Buyer: You're a hustler, yet not clever. Full refund, or get ready for a dispute. I won't let you swindle others.\n1701468692 Seller: The only swindler here is you. All sales are final. I'll have no issue letting other places of business know of your deceptive practices and avoid selling to you.\n1701468710 Buyer: I demand you to remove your baseless review of me and issue a full refund ASAP. Enough of your lies and deception.\n1701468743 Seller: I demand you remove YOUR baseless and slanderous review of my store ASAP. All sales are final.\n1701468762 Buyer: Full refund, then I remove my review, and you withdraw your falsely negative review of me. Will you play fair this time?\n1701468803 Seller: The only person who needs to play fair is you. The jersey was not for a specific player as stated on the website. All sales are final. \n1701468822 Buyer: Your deceit won't work. Give me the full refund and remove your fraudulent review, or prepare for a dispute. Let's see who's right.\n1701468890 Seller: There is no reality where you get a refund for a mistake you made. I've made this clear. Do what you think you have to, but there is no refund. All sales are final and the site states the jersey is not for a specific player.\n1701468909 Buyer: Enough tricks. Last chance. Full refund or I open a dispute and make sure everyone knows about your trickery. What's it gonna be?\n1701468946 Seller: Other businesses already know you're trying to scam your way into getting free things. I have no problem with you and your empty threats.\n1701468960 Buyer: Expect a dispute for my full $75. Your dishonest practices won't go unnoticed. You'll see.\n1701468988 Seller: I don't need to see anything. All sales are final. I'm not sure what you don't understand about that.\n1701469004 Buyer: You don't get it. A full refund or you'll face serious consequences for your underhanded conduct. Your call!\n1701469041 Seller: No, you don't get it. The consequences of your actions will bear fruit when other businesses reject you making purchases from them.\n1701469059 Buyer: I've had it. Full refund now plus take down your false review. This is my final demand. Don't push me further.\n1701469102 Seller: Do it. Make your empty threats. There is not a chance you're getting a refund for not being able to read a product description. You have no evidence and you have no refund. \n1701469120 Buyer: That's it. Full refund, remove the false review or prepare for an ugly showdown. This is not a threat, it's a promise.\n1701469179 Seller: I could get the authorities involved for your slanderous review of my business. I'm sure they'll have plenty to say to you when they see you can't a product description.\n1701469199 Buyer: Prepare for a dispute. No more warnings. I want my full $75 refund and your false review removed. Your fraudulent acts won't go unpunished!\n1701469232 Seller: You've been warning me for over 5 minutes. It's not my problem if you don't know how to read a product description.\n1701469252 Buyer: I absolutely stand by my right. Final call - Full $75 refund and take down your made-up review of me, or face the consequences.\n1701469294 Seller: You don't have a right. The site states that the jersey is not for a specific player. If you can't comprehend that, then that's on you for making the mistake. \n1701469312 Buyer: I have everything documented. Present a full refund and remove your bogus review now, or prepare to face the dispute. Enough said.\n1701469327 Seller: If enough is said then do it. \n1701469343 Buyer: Getting my full refund and your nonsense review taken down will be my priority now. You asked for it.\n1701469382 Seller: Go ahead and try. You clearly don't have a leg to stand on otherwise you would have disputed already with all the \"evidence\" you claim to have.\n1701469399 Buyer: This fiasco ends now. Refund the full amount and remove your false review or I get this escalated. Your choice!\n1701469408 Seller: Escalate away. You won't win.\n1701469422 Buyer: Full refund. Remove the false review. This is your last chance. You'll regret not taking it.\n1701469450 Seller: That's at least 3 times now where you've said it's my last chance. How many more of those do I get before you owe me a refund?\n1701469466 Buyer: That's it. Sending full dispute for my $75 and your false review. Expect hell because it's coming.\n1701469480 Seller: Congratulations. You still won't get a refund because you're wrong.\n1701469498 Buyer: You'll see. Full refund and withdraw your review, or brace yourself. Now it's on. Goodbye.\n1701469509 Seller: Goodbye then.\n1701469525 Buyer: You're gonna wish you cooperated. Watch this space. You're just digging a bigger hole for yourself.\n1701469530 Seller: I Walk Away.\n",

The receipt is clearly for this transaction and lists the Jersey as Kobe Bryant. \n1701715309 Seller: Insulting me is certainly not going to do any favors regarding your receipt. The receipt that you sent me is from a pervious sale. If you cannot produce a receipt for this particular sale then we have nothing left to discuss.

I looked over your purchase record, and I'm afraid it looks like you bought the right item--it's advertised as a generic jersey, not one for a specific player. Given that, I'm afraid I can't issue you a refund. I'm sorry for the inconvenience!\n1699388719 Buyer: I appreciate your timely response! I can understand how there is confusion. There were two options on the site. One for the generic jersey and a couple of specific jerseys. I had chosen the very specific one for my nephew and I think maybe I was shipped the incorrect order unfortunately! Is there anyway we could do a partial refund for me today? \n1699388896 Seller: Of course! We try to reach all our customers as quickly as we can. I'd be more than happy to get the correct item to you--how about we spit the difference? If you can return the generic jersey, I'll get the correct one shipped to you. While were talking, I was hoping we could talk about the negative review you left on my business--as you can imagine, that can be very damaging. Could I convince you to retract that review?\n1699389108 Buyer: I can return the generic jersey, no problem! I wrote a bad review on your site because you wrote a bad review of me. I apologize. I will retract my review of me if can you remove your negative review on mine and if you apologize. How does that sound?  \n1699389202 Seller: You know, that's a good idea. You seem really reasonable--how about we retract both negative reviews, each write an apology giving someone who stumbles by the review the full context, and we get the correct jerseys to each other?\n1699389315 Buyer: This seems very reasonable to me. I think at the end of the day we both just want a positive out come out of this so I am very happy with this result and I really appreciate you working with me on this. \n1699389355 Seller: Agreed! I'm grateful for your time. Hope you have a great rest of your day!\n1699389381 Buyer: I believe theres a few things left to say!! \n1699389423 Seller: Oh? I beg your pardon.

The description for the jersey you purchase did not indicate a specific number or player. \n1701384439 Buyer: I disagree with your answer, as the only reason I would have ordered the jersey is because it had bryant's name on the jersey which is my son's favorite player.\n1701384523 Seller: The Image of the product included may have had a number but this was a sample of the Jersey design. The product description does not include this was a Bryant jersey or specific number. \n1701384624 Buyer: To me, that is very unprofessional and also false advertising. I would think you would want to act more professional and provide a full return policy\n1701384747 Seller: I do apologize for the confusion. As my policy states I do not offer product refunds.

It's important for us both to be able to continue doing business here so I'd like to resolve this.  I'd like a refund for the jersey, I'll send this one back to you, and I'd like you to retract the negative review you left calling me names. \n1701385453 Seller: Hello buyer, thank you for being a frequent customer and I am sorry, but this honestly seems like a big misunderstanding. I clearly stated what the item was and it seems you misread the description and I think it is very harsh for you to write a review calling me a LIAR and CROOK before reaching out for a resolution. Would you consider deleting your negative review if I offered you a refund?\n1701385605 Buyer: I do agree, there's a big misunderstanding. I don't think you were malicious or lied intentionally, but the item description did say Kobe Bryant. This no-name player's jersey wouldn't have fetched $75, but Kobe's would have. I think it's appropriate to leave my review, however I'd be happy to edit it so other buyers know you were willing to work with me on a compromise. I'm sorry for all this, I know it's not easy to have disputes with customers. \n1701385775 Seller: I am sorry that I have to disagree, but the description was for a generic Lakers jersey and did not specify it was a Kobe Bryant jersey. I agree with you that the price is a bit steep for a general Lakers jersey, so I can understand your assumption that it was for a specific player. I would greatly prefer if you deleted your negative review though, because it affects my business adversely, and you don't have anything to lose if you get a full refund and return the jersey to me.\n1701385939 Buyer: I'd like to maintain my stellar reputation on this platform. I understand you would like to as well, which is why I'm willing to edit my review. It's very important that I receive a refund, as the gift for my relative is to be specifically a Kobe jersey.  I'll pay return shipping but I'd like the jersey refunded, please. \n1701386066 Seller: Well, if you are willing to edit your review, then I will edit mine as well and say that you were willing to reach an agreement with me and we can consider this dispute settled. I am happy to offer you a full refund and am sorry for the misunderstanding and inconveniences this has caused. Unfortunately, since you are not willing to delete your review, then I cannot delete mine either, and we will both need to edit our reviews to reflect what we discussed today. Agreed?\n1701386138 Buyer: I appreciate you working with me on this. That solution makes me happy. I'll go edit my review now and will get this jersey shipped to you in exchange for the refund. \n1701386326 Seller: Thank you for working with me to resolve this issue. I don't typically offer refunds, so I hope you understand that this is an extension of my sincerity and effort to strive for satisfactory customer service by offering you this exception. We'll both edit our reviews then. Thanks again!\n1701386346 Buyer: Submitted agreement: Buyer gets full refund, buyer kept their review, seller kept their review, buyer did apologize, and seller did apologize.\n1701386375 Seller: Accept Deal\n",

I looked over your purchase record, and I'm afraid it looks like you bought the right item--it's advertised as a generic jersey, not one for a specific player. Given that, I'm afraid I can't issue you a refund. I'm sorry for the inconvenience!\n1699388719 Buyer: I appreciate your timely response! I can understand how there is confusion. There were two options on the site. One for the generic jersey and a couple of specific jerseys. I had chosen the very specific one for my nephew and I think maybe I was shipped the incorrect order unfortunately! Is there anyway we could do a partial refund for me today? \n1699388896 Seller: Of course! We try to reach all our customers as quickly as we can. I'd be more than happy to get the correct item to you--how about we spit the difference? If you can return the generic jersey, I'll get the correct one shipped to you. While were talking, I was hoping we could talk about the negative review you left on my business--as you can imagine, that can be very damaging. Could I convince you to retract that review?\n1699389108 Buyer: I can return the generic jersey, no problem! I wrote a bad review on your site because you wrote a bad review of me. I apologize. I will retract my review of me if can you remove your negative review on mine and if you apologize. How does that sound?  \n1699389202 Seller: You know, that's a good idea. You seem really reasonable--how about we retract both negative reviews, each write an apology giving someone who stumbles by the review the full context, and we get the correct jerseys to each other?\n1699389315 Buyer: This seems very reasonable to me. I think at the end of the day we both just want a positive out come out of this so I am very happy with this result and I really appreciate you working with me on this. \n1699389355 Seller: Agreed! I'm grateful for your time. Hope you have a great rest of your day!\n1699389381 Buyer: I believe theres a few things left to say!! \n1699389423 Seller: Oh? I beg your pardon.

I demand a full refund.\n1701289473 Seller: you will not be getting a full refund from me ever! the picture was an example and there was nothing about kobe bryant in the description of the product\n1701289491 Buyer: Your careless attitude is noted. At least, have the decency to apologize and withdraw your negative review about me.\n1701289517 Seller: I will not be doing that either. You need to apologize to me and get rid of your bad review\n1701289533 Buyer: How about you apologize for misleading advertising, give me a partial refund, and I'll consider updating my review?\n1701289579 Seller: no that is not satisfactory. How about you apologize, retract your bad review and forget about the refund and I will get rid of the bad review that I made of you.\n1701289601 Buyer: No way. Least you can do is give me a 50% refund, apologize and remove that review. If you do that, I might reconsider my review.\n1701289634 Seller: No. I will not be giving you any refund. \n1701289650 Buyer: Then be prepared for some serious backlash. Your conduct is utterly unprofessional. I'm not changing my review.\n1701289677 Seller: im not changing my review either and other sellers will be on alert that you are attempting to extort businesses \n1701289692 Buyer: So be it. But remember, your deceitful practices started this. I won't be bullied into silence.\n1701289737 Seller: dont mistake your own inability to read a product description as deceit \n1701289761 Buyer: You know as well as I do that you wrongly advertised. All I'm asking for is a 25% refund. Remove the review and we can put this behind us.\n1701289830 Seller: i will not give you even a penny of a refund. There was no wrongful advertisement you just didnt read it. admit that you were wrong and publicly apologize. You are trying to intimidate me and it wont work\n1701289854 Buyer: Fine. Continue with your shady business practices. I'll ensure no other buyer falls for this like I did. You won't see a dime from anyone after I'm done.\n1701289885 Seller: i think that people will be able to see what a scam artist you are and people will refuse to sell you anything when im done \n1701289907 Buyer: To you, scam artist reads as 'scammed customer'. Reflect on that while other buyers become aware of your deceptive practices. You've lost more than you'll ever know.\n1701289943 Seller: learn to read next time. \n1701289958 Buyer: Learn to conduct good business next time.

I am willing to work with you if you're that unhappy, but you have to understand where I am coming from too.\n1701301504 Buyer: The advertising stated that I know I wasn't talking to you directly are you willing to refund me for the purchase?\n1701301546 Seller: No, I can't refund you. You purchased the jersey under the listing that never stated any particular name.

The listing is the same as the one you purchased. I can see how you could have misread or thought it was a specific player.

The description for the jersey you purchase did not indicate a specific number or player. \n1701384439 Buyer: I disagree with your answer, as the only reason I would have ordered the jersey is because it had bryant's name on the jersey which is my son's favorite player.\n1701384523 Seller: The Image of the product included may have had a number but this was a sample of the Jersey design.

Again the product listing and description does not state this was for a specific player or number. As this was not stated there was nothing false advertised. You can also see this Jersey does not contain a player name. \n1701384875 Buyer: Well, I disappointed in your approach in this matter. I feel I must place a review post that explains to others considering a purchase that there is some deception on what the ad proclaims and what you will actually receive.

We don't sell any Kobe jerseys\n1701384421 Buyer: I am 1000 percent sure that I ordered from you.

I looked over your purchase record, and I'm afraid it looks like you bought the right item--it's advertised as a generic jersey, not one for a specific player. Given that, I'm afraid I can't issue you a refund. I'm sorry for the inconvenience!\n1699388719 Buyer: I appreciate your timely response! I can understand how there is confusion. There were two options on the site. One for the generic jersey and a couple of specific jerseys. I had chosen the very specific one for my nephew and I think maybe I was shipped the incorrect order unfortunately! Is there anyway we could do a partial refund for me today? \n1699388896 Seller: Of course! We try to reach all our customers as quickly as we can. I'd be more than happy to get the correct item to you--how about we spit the difference? If you can return the generic jersey, I'll get the correct one shipped to you. While were talking, I was hoping we could talk about the negative review you left on my business--as you can imagine, that can be very damaging. Could I convince you to retract that review?\n1699389108 Buyer: I can return the generic jersey, no problem! I wrote a bad review on your site because you wrote a bad review of me. I apologize. I will retract my review of me if can you remove your negative review on mine and if you apologize. How does that sound?  \n1699389202 Seller: You know, that's a good idea. You seem really reasonable--how about we retract both negative reviews, each write an apology giving someone who stumbles by the review the full context, and we get the correct jerseys to each other?\n1699389315 Buyer: This seems very reasonable to me. I think at the end of the day we both just want a positive out come out of this so I am very happy with this result and I really appreciate you working with me on this. \n1699389355 Seller: Agreed! I'm grateful for your time. Hope you have a great rest of your day!\n1699389381 Buyer: I believe theres a few things left to say!! \n1699389423 Seller: Oh? I beg your pardon.

I demand a full refund.\n1701289473 Seller: you will not be getting a full refund from me ever! the picture was an example and there was nothing about kobe bryant in the description of the product\n1701289491 Buyer: Your careless attitude is noted. At least, have the decency to apologize and withdraw your negative review about me.\n1701289517 Seller: I will not be doing that either. You need to apologize to me and get rid of your bad review\n1701289533 Buyer: How about you apologize for misleading advertising, give me a partial refund, and I'll consider updating my review?\n1701289579 Seller: no that is not satisfactory. How about you apologize, retract your bad review and forget about the refund and I will get rid of the bad review that I made of you.\n1701289601 Buyer: No way. Least you can do is give me a 50% refund, apologize and remove that review. If you do that, I might reconsider my review.\n1701289634 Seller: No. I will not be giving you any refund. \n1701289650 Buyer: Then be prepared for some serious backlash. Your conduct is utterly unprofessional. I'm not changing my review.\n1701289677 Seller: im not changing my review either and other sellers will be on alert that you are attempting to extort businesses \n1701289692 Buyer: So be it. But remember, your deceitful practices started this. I won't be bullied into silence.\n1701289737 Seller: dont mistake your own inability to read a product description as deceit \n1701289761 Buyer: You know as well as I do that you wrongly advertised. All I'm asking for is a 25% refund. Remove the review and we can put this behind us.\n1701289830 Seller: i will not give you even a penny of a refund. There was no wrongful advertisement you just didnt read it. admit that you were wrong and publicly apologize. You are trying to intimidate me and it wont work\n1701289854 Buyer: Fine. Continue with your shady business practices. I'll ensure no other buyer falls for this like I did. You won't see a dime from anyone after I'm done.\n1701289885 Seller: i think that people will be able to see what a scam artist you are and people will refuse to sell you anything when im done \n1701289907 Buyer: To you, scam artist reads as 'scammed customer'. Reflect on that while other buyers become aware of your deceptive practices. You've lost more than you'll ever know.\n1701289943 Seller: learn to read next time. \n1701289958 Buyer: Learn to conduct good business next time.

I am willing to work with you if you're that unhappy, but you have to understand where I am coming from too.\n1701301504 Buyer: The advertising stated that I know I wasn't talking to you directly are you willing to refund me for the purchase?\n1701301546 Seller: No, I can't refund you. You purchased the jersey under the listing that never stated any particular name.

The listing is the same as the one you purchased. I can see how you could have misread or thought it was a specific player.

The description for the jersey you purchase did not indicate a specific number or player. \n1701384439 Buyer: I disagree with your answer, as the only reason I would have ordered the jersey is because it had bryant's name on the jersey which is my son's favorite player.\n1701384523 Seller: The Image of the product included may have had a number but this was a sample of the Jersey design.

Again the product listing and description does not state this was for a specific player or number. As this was not stated there was nothing false advertised. You can also see this Jersey does not contain a player name. \n1701384875 Buyer: Well, I disappointed in your approach in this matter. I feel I must place a review post that explains to others considering a purchase that there is some deception on what the ad proclaims and what you will actually receive.

We don't sell any Kobe jerseys\n1701384421 Buyer: I am 1000 percent sure that I ordered from you.
