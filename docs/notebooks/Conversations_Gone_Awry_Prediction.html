<p>This interactive tutorial demonstrates how to predict whether a conversation will eventually lead to a personal attack, as seen in the paper <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Conversations_gone_awry.html">Conversations Gone Awry: Detecting Early Signs of Conversational Failure</a>, using the tools provided by ConvoKit. It also serves as an illustration of how to use two transformers implemented by ConvoKit: PromptTypes and politeness strategies.</p>
<p>Note that due to updates in the implementation of ConvoKit modules as well as libraries we’ve used, the results in the notebook deviate slightly from what was presented in the paper; however, the overall findings match fairly closely. NOTE: for an updated version of the <code>PromptTypes</code> method, using the Expected Conversational Context <a href="https://tisjune.github.io/research/dissertation">Framework</a> and the <code>ExpectedContextModel</code> <a href="https://convokit.cornell.edu/documentation/expected_context_model.html">functionality</a>, see <a href="https://github.com/CornellNLP/ConvoKit/blob/master/convokit/expected_context_framework/demos/wiki_awry_demo.ipynb">this notebook</a>, which uses the same datasets. We keep this demo around to more closely match with the original publication.</p>

<p>The original Awry paper and dataset was released at ACL 2018. In the time since initial release, the dataset has been expanded with additional labeled samples, with the later annotation rounds focusing on longer conversations. Since this example notebook is based on the original Awry paper, we will now filter the corpus to keep only the conversations from the original dataset. This can be achieved by checking the “annotation_year” metadata entry; original data will have the value “2018”. However, if you may also skip this filtering stage (skip directly to “Step 2: Extract prompt types features”) if you wish to run the model on the complete dataset (note that the notebook will take quite a while longer to run).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-2-extract-prompt-types-features">Step 2: Extract prompt types features</h2>
<p>In this step, we will extract the first of the two types of pragmatic features seen in the paper: prompt types. We can learn prompt types and compute types for each utterance in the corpus using ConvoKit’s PromptTypeWrapper class (which implements an end-to-end pipeline that extracts prompt types; see <a href="https://github.com/CornellNLP/ConvoKit/blob/master/examples/prompt-types/prompt-type-demo.ipynb">this notebook</a> for examples of particular steps in that pipeline). Note that in keeping with proper machine learning practices, we need a different dataset to use for training the PromptTypeWrapper object. For this, we will use Convokit’s Wikipedia talk corpus (“wiki-corpus”), which is composed of Wikipedia talk page conversations different from those found in the Awry corpus.</p>

<p>Here are the six prompt types that our model has inferred – i.e., prototypical features of the prompts and responses, as well as prototypical utterances for each type.</p>
<p>Note that due to updates in SpaCy’s dependency parsing, as well as in our implementation of the prompt types methodology, the particular types returned don’t fully align with what’s in the paper (though we see that they recover similar prompt types, and down the line may result in better performance accuracies).</p>

366191 It was an awesome game. You just had to see it live to feel the pain I guess. So you never saw many of the greats play? I've kinda lost touch with modern footy, hence my only AFL contributions being kinda old hat. I was almost 18 when that game kicked off. Old enough to take it hard :) --

419258 Hehe, I remember how crazy it can be. Enjoy it while you can! College life beats real life. :P But I do hope you're doing great. As for me, I recently finished my Master's degree, which freed up my time considerably, let me tell ya! I'm contributing again to the Spanish Wikipedia quite actively. I had missed editing articles, isn't that funny? But when I returned to the English wikipedia, I saw that many of the \"old\" faces were gone. Allstarecho, David Shankbone, WJBscribe (although it seems he's back now, yay), you... I guess it can't be helped, life does go on. But I was happy to see you pop up on my watchlist the other day. :) Maybe you'll let the wikibug bite you again, hehe. Cheers

552732 The arbitrator was talking about whether or not to blank the talk page. That has no bearing on whether or not EffK is entitled to edit it: he is not. His ban is total. Violating a ban gets the ban extended. This is not a matter of my personal interpretation. It is, fractionally, interpretive whether or not the talk page should be blanked. It is immaterial to the banned user, however, since they are forbidden from editing it in any case. He has no right to edit anywhere on Wikipedia, nor to use his talk page to continue to engage in exactly that which got him banned.  It ''is'' invention that he is only banned from articles and his userpage, since the Arbitration remedy says no such thing.

510815 Well, I'm currently working on a program similar to VandalProof but with many more gizmos that will be usable on ''any'' foundation wiki, but it won't be available for another couple of months. However, VP1.3 has the ability to be easily adapted for multiple wikis. If you, or someone else, would be willing to spend some time translating string tables, I'd have no problem adapting it for frwiki. I'll try to get back to you in a few days, but if I don't, please feel free to nag me.

375655 Thanks much sj! Your user\/talk page and Wikipedia experience is impressive! I've got a small list of easy edits just to get started with, and I'll begin those this weekend.

Just a heads up, there may be some lapses in my edits and responses, I am a full time student with three jobs and am very busy, but I am willing to work at this, and would very much would like to be a good editor.

471653 Thanks for asking me about this again. The timing's not great, as I have a few other things going at the moment, but once I've got those out of the way (in a couple of weeks), I think I have been procrastinating long enough and would like to look into what areas of admin backlogs I could help out with, and then submit an RfA (or ask someone like you if they would like to nominate me). Once I've done that, I'll get back to you.

448308 Hi - I'll be only too happy to help you out! I would prefer to work thru e-mail - will this be convenient for you?

7853 Hello. I am back now and will be working on the Forum Invest article this week. I hope that you will be able to help and look over some of the links I have added to support the article, if you have some time. I am also waiting on some links from more notable European Institutions which have mentioned the company so that I can add them as well. I will also work on rewording some of the text so that it does not match the company's website. As usual, any help that you can provide is greatly appreciated, please let me know of any changes I can make to ensure the article complies with all of Wikipedia's regulations.

288206 Back when the Nirvana article was a COTW (in like September I think) I started working out a \"Musical style\" section on a userpage, but never finished it. Would you like to help out with it?

147397 I took your advice, and done just that. I see you have 120 edits done on The Beatles discography, being the only person who has more edits than me. Anyway, the point I'm trying to make, is ...''I'm asking''... if you could please help me on my sandbox page, and maybe we can turn this discography into an FL status one. I know you can write good (and good narrative prose), maybe you can work on the prose like you've done for the original discography, or do what you feel needs improved, I won't mind. So, you have my permission to edit on that sandbox page, if you like, and when it's all done, maybe we can transfer it over in place of the discography that's already there. I need and want help on this, and you're the best! Thanks! (''Awaiting your response''} Best, --[[User:Discographer|Discographer]] ([[User talk:Discographer|talk]]) 20:42, 28 September 2009 (UTC)

263144 I did not say Metformin should not obey policies and regulations, what I said is ''it would be more productive to avoid citing them at each other''. My point is that discussions conducted in the plane of Wikilaw between us are never fruitful. Both of our views are based on policies, guidelines and precedents. We know them well, we can cite them in support of our views. But what we usually argue about is in gray areas of Wikilaw. That is why I suggest to base discussions between us on the universal law of reason.

604297 I agree that it is indeed a logical fallacy to conclude the truth of some statement from the fact that most (or even everybody) think it is true. However, I don't see where I have committed this mistake. In the second sentence of the fragment quoted to above, I say that the \"Bosnian\/NATO point of view\" is far more widespread than the Serbian one, which implies that it should get more attention since \"[i]f we are to represent the dispute fairly, we should present competing views in proportion to their representation among experts on the subject, or among the concerned parties\" (quoting from [[WP:NPOV]]). What I do believe to be the case, though I am not saying above, is that widespread belief strongly ''suggests'' truth. --

133268 The Mahayana sutras often claim that the Buddha gave teachings in other realms that were then later revealed to human practitioners. This is not a question of history, it is a question of whether the reader choses to believe that or not. The providence of the Mahayana sutras is clear in the article. It is not appropriate for wikipedia to adopt a POV about whether those claims are \"fictional\" or not - the reader can decide for him or herself. The article on Jesus says \"the Gospels state that Jesus rose from the dead.\" It does not state, \"the Gospels state that Jesus rose from the dead, an obviously fictional claim.\"

32816 The main reason that PAR\u2019s revert was reasonable is that your changed wording implies that the tax savings are the important driving cause of wealth condensation, but that\u2019s clearly wrong. Saving and investment lead to wealth accumulation because the value of investments increases over time as the society prospers and its economy grows. The poorest of the poor pay very little tax, and for good reason \u2013 they need all the money they can get just to pay for food. The richest of the rich don\u2019t need to spend much money as a percentage of their wealth, so they invest it instead. This is true whether the tax system is progressive or regressive, whether the rate is 1% or 60%, whether its form is sales tax or property tax or capital gains tax. In other words, the tax differences are a distraction to the main point, and elevating them as you did would make the sentence misleading. \u2013

62039 One more time. You acknowledge there is a dispute over the cause of death, that it is \"still a question.\". You also say that \"most historians\" do not present a definitive report.  Therefore, [[WP:NPOV]], which is policy requires that all sides of the dispute be presented. I note that the Vietnamese Wikipedia article states that \"In a battle fierce fighting, Phan Dinh Phung seriously injured, and died on 28 December in 1895\" (per Google translation). It also cites a source, which the Google translation doesn't provide a clear of identification of for me to review. But in the absence of any definitive proof as to which account is correct, Wikipedia policy requires that both versions be presented in the article, without presenting a preferred version as factual. I highly doubt that MILHIST will dispute the application of NPOV, given the fact that you acknowledge the existence of a dispute as to the cause of death.

504589 In addition, what is most relevant is not whether or not Freedom House, or any other individual source or organization, considers Israel to be free\/democratic\/etc, but that Israel is widely and generally considered to be such. Citing Freedom House does not in any way help to prove this. You yourself have said that Wikipedia guidelines dictate that we \"avoid weasel words where possible\", yet your statement that \"Israel is ''considered'' a liberal democracy\" by this one particular source (which, incidentally, I had never heard of before) is really equivalent to saying \"Israel is considered by some (but not necessarily others)...\" or \"Israel is considered by Freedom House (but not necessarily anyone else) to be a liberal democracy.\" You may not be stating it outright, but you're still employing the logic of weasel words. This is why we need a source that explicitly and directly, with citations to other reputable sources, states outright that Israel is widely and generally considered to be a liberal democracy. To cite that Freedom House considers it so makes no solid statement on whether anyone else considers it so, thus making the citation meaningless, regardless of how reliable or reputable you may believe Freedom House to be as a source.

395385 Salman; I understand what you are saying - but this causes a revert war that will never stop. Those who are not Shi'a and do not believe he was martyred, can point at the physical body of a martyr and say they are physically, medically dead. Yes, alive spiritually (at least in the eyes of Shi'a) and therefore not 'totally' dead - but there is still a physically medically dead body left behind. Therefore to say they are not dead may be correct in the spiritual sense, but physically, medically is just not accurate. You cannot force others to believe everything you believe - this is what causes conflicts. You can only say what is universal - in this case, there is a medically dead body that meets the physical prerequisites for a doctor to declare them 'dead' and someone to collect the insurance. Then you can say that you believe them to be martyr and therefore have a different status. But there must be a common ground that can be found.

39839 Hi. I happen to be an expert in nomenclature and taxonomy. There is a formal, official Code governing the proper spelling of scientific names (the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]). One of the rules is that the name of a species must agree in gender with the name of the genus. The name \"Pyrops\" is masculine, and all names in the genus must be formed to also be masculine. While it is true that nearly everyone in the world refers to the species as \"candelaria\", those folks who do so are all wrong, and their ignorance of the rule is no reason to perpetuate the misspelling. That's exactly why rules of nomenclature exist; so when there is a difference of opinion, there is one clear and definitive answer. The genus ''Pyrops'' is masculine, therefore, all the species names in the genus must also be masculine.

249222 I understood what you meant.  Re my style, it's not so much that I agree with the [[MOS:FILM]], but have you read it?

486463 I agree with you on some points, but actually the major part of the section includes not biases and criticism, but the facts all russian mass media talked about. This guy insulted a woman at a press conference, which was legally and officially recorded on video, and attacked another singer in the restaurant - with whatever neutral words it is said, it remains a fact, and there is enough evidence for it. That's why the section is called \"Scandals\" and not \"Criticism\". And I didn't find where [[WP:BLP]] says - \"delete all unreferenced stuff which may be controversal ''immediately'' without asking for sources or discussing\". That's the point. Best Regards \/

52791 Yo, does everything on this article that I put up have to be uniform to your type of writing?  Please explain this to me.  Also, is it necessary to mention \"conservative talk radio program\" ?  I think saying Levin is enough.  No other quote mentions the name of the radio program or news channel, it is unnecessary, that is what cited sources is for... also, I don't believe it is a neutral point of view because many will reject the paragraph once they see \"conservative talk\".. and like I said before, it doesn't matter what show it is, the notable person said something and is worth quoting.

324357 As above. I have noticed Yuje gaming the 3RR rules by previously stopping eveytime three reverts were made, but I suppose he couldn't control himself this time. Bringing in content disagreements into discussions here is also irrelevant, if he understands the basis for the 3RR in the first place. Wikipedia is not a democracy, and just because I was the minority in opposing his attempts to add inaccurate information (along with a whole bunch of like-minded individuals who have continously ganged up to oppose me) does not mean my comments are invalid or inaccurate. And to claim that I was singling him out to revert war is hardly any further from the truth. I act based on factual content, and not on the person. If the person chooses to continously add factual errors, then inevitably, it is his edits which will be constantly scrutinised, although far from the [[wikistalking]] ways of another [[User:instantnood|famed user]].--

97664 Sunray, my problem is that because of reverting direktors lead edits (\"Chetniks collborators\") I was acccused of \"Battleground mentality\" and \"disruptive behavior\" (it is what it says on ARBMAC!) because direktor purposly didn\xb4t informed in the report (to which I wasn\xb4t notified to, so I couldn\xb4t explain it myself) about the mediation and the complexities of the case. He just presented it as \"insistent removal of sourced content\". I need you, as mediator, please to explain to the admin that the case is not that simple and that his edit is the exact reason why the mediation started in first place. I need that because otherwise a totaly wrong impression is left. If I was, for exemple, glorifiying them in leads, as much sources as I could add direktor would certainly claim that he is rightfully reverting to the previous version. I think the admin doesn\xb4t beleave me, or something, and i am planing to appeal the decition, however I do hope that with someones clarification it wan\xb4t be necessary, or at least the unfair observation will be removed. I was definitely not disruptive neither it was ''me'' having a battleground mentality, but rather direktor who knows those edits must be discussed and would be reverted, that is for sure. The admin seems to think that Direktor was making fine sourced contributions, and I was the one being desruptive, which is definitely not fair, and was a situation created actually by direktor to punish me.

1601 I'm confused why you believe that I am edit warring ([[User_talk:Stargat#Edit_Warrior|this note on my page]]). Last week we discussed the inclusion of the fact that stock photography was used on the Newt Gingrich fundraising committee website, which you seem to think is important but I think is trivial. I gave a [[Talk:Newt_Gingrich_presidential_campaign,_2012|perfectly reasonable explanation]] for why it should not be included, but you did not respond. Specifically, I challenged your claim that it was \"widely covered\" and demonstrated it was not. Several days later, without any response, I changed it back. Now, I see that you still have not responded on the talk page, but your edit summary stated that \"there is no clear dispute of the material on the talk page\". That's not true. I don't dispute that it's factual, but I do dispute that it's relevant. Based on guidelines, I don't think it belongs. And please do not accuse me of edit warring. I aim to be polite and discuss changes based on policy, but for some reason you won't talk to me.

I said I had a \"proposal for them\", I didn't say that the proposal was that ''they'' would change policy. However, that is not so relevant. What ''is'' relevant is that even your apology is in violation of talk page guidelines, and, as per the template recently added to the top of the page, should be removed immediately as such.

462114 Fantasy, just to clarify, because we had discussed this some before.  At the time your grandfather died in prison wasn't his political goal more for having the province join again with Austria?  It seems by the mid 60s there was a situation with relatively equal language rights and an influential SVP; please correct me if I'm wrong.  Anyway, I believe no one is saying to remove any names.  The opposite is true, and I would personally insist that the Italian, German, and most importantly local dialects are included.  Also, it is a good learning experience to also realize that others in the region were pushed down in the past.  In order for the German language to come into this region originally, it took some domination over the locals.  So it is a cycle that goes on and on.  The most important thing is it for it to stop and &lt;u&gt;people&lt;\/u&gt; to live as neighbors and friends.  take care.

587533 Hi Mecu, I think by now you have seen my post at the RfC, but I wanted to respond to you directly.  My thought is that Ed was wrong on this issue, and that he did break policy.  However, I wouldn't call for desysopping of an admin based upon one bad act.  Also, as a practical matter, it is clear that a lot of people think he actually behaved appropriately.  That is very disapointing to me, but it is what it is and it shows that we are a long way away from support for desysopping.  Desysopping is a very rare event, by the way.  I don't know the exact number of people that have been desysopped, but it is only a handful - less than 10 I think.  There are some proposals along the lines of making \"admin recall\" a little easier, please see [[:Category:Administrators_open_to_recall]], for instance.

22654 My point is very simple, and doesn't require all that refutation.  What you wrote about the Morgan family name is absolutely fine, it just belongs in the article on the Morgan family name, with perhaps a link in LHM's article to the article on the name.  Yes, you quoted a source - I didn't say it was unreferenced.  But the source doesn't mention LHM at all, so the inference on our part connecting him to the family is indeed synthesis, ''even if it is true''.  So, a simple way to avoid some editor simply deleting the material as irrelevant at some point is to move it to [[Morgan (surname)]] to which you can still link in the LHM article, and where that material will also benefit readers of the article on the name.

275172 Patton's representative contacted the foundation about this matter and I handled the case. You say Patton's representative \"could not provide a valid reference for the middle name change\" but could you provide a valid reference for the name that you repeatedly restored? I ask because the version of the article I came to had no source at all cited and I looked back through a number of different versions of the article and it doesn't seem to have ever been sourced and actually seems to have first been added by an IP user [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Will_Patton&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=221627312&amp;oldid=214695609]. Interestingly, the IP who added that information made one other edit that day and that was to add false information to the [[Lewis Black]] article [http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/w\/index.php?title=Lewis_Black&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=221567288]. While IMDb is generally considered a questionable source under the reliable sources guideline due to the fact the bulk of their material is user-generated, in this case we have on the one hand a completely unsourced BLP containing questionable unsourced information and on the other, a representative of the subject telling us this information is incorrect and that IMDb's information is correct. WP:RS is very important but don't forget it is a guideline and it doesn't trump the policy on biographies of living people which requires questionable unsourced information be \"removed immediately and without waiting for discussion\" and also clearly states that we should \"remove any unsourced material to which an editor objects in good faith\". We absolutely should not be maintaining unsourced information in BLPs that we've been told by the subject's representative is false. I can understand you generally not wanting to accept IMDb as a source and I've explained to Patton's people that IMDb is considered a questionable source for most information due to the user generated content, but I cannot understand you insisting on maintaining unsourced information in a BLP when you've been told it is incorrect and repeatedly reverting to keep the unsourced information in the article. I would have understood if you'd just removed the middle name entirely on being told it was incorrect as as it's really not vital to have a person's middle name and no middle name is certainly better than a false one, but I can't understand you insisting that the unsourced name had to remain in the article in the face of a representative of the artist saying it was not only unsourced but incorrect. Even if you don't believe the person was who they claimed, the fact remains the information originally in the article was unsourced and someone was making what appeared to be a good faith attempt to tell us this information is incorrect. Think about this carefully for a moment: The original middle name that you repeated restored to the article was unsourced. While I agree that IMDb is not a great source to use, it's certainly a step up from no source at all. I will also add that I'm not entirely comfortable with the way you were using rollback in this case. Rollback should only be used on vandalism and blatantly unproductive edits. Those edits were made by someone you knew was identifying themselves as a representative of the subject and there was no evidence at all to suggest that they were a vandal or otherwise editing in bad faith, rather they had explained that they were making a good faith attempt to remove incorrect unsourced information from a BLP, which is entirely supported by policy. This was more like a content dispute and it is not what rollback is meant to be used for. I would really urge you to be more careful with your use of rollback in future and perhaps have another look over the rollback guideline.

412454 I've translated the French Wikipedia article and added it to the English Wikipedia. I'm not sure where one would find English-language resources for a French commune with a population of only 195 people, but there are some links to French resources, which I can check out as time permits.  Do you have a specific interest in this particular commune?

514579 Also, don't know if you noticed the discussion on talk (with Shoemaker) where I presented a comparison of spade and notspade in the context of strategy. Shoemaker thought it should be added to NOTSPADE and I tried to fit it in earlier, but I couldn't find a way to make it work. I was thinking, maybe rather than adding to NOTSPADE, I could create a new essay called \"strategic editing\" or \"assertive editing\". I still think that there's a lot of misunderstanding about NOTSPADE - Shoemaker's initial comments are indicative of that misunderstanding - and could use further clarification to sway the battle-weary. Any thoughts?

56336 Hi. [http:\/\/www.geocities.com\/SiliconValley\/Lab\/7378\/alekhine.htm Here] Bill Wall mentions ''The Oxford Companion to Chess'' when speaking about Alekhine's studies in Sorbonna.

502564 Coins parsers replace the content of the span with a link; I think the span could be empty, but it can't go around article text. If you use Firefox, there's an extension, [http:\/\/nj.oclc.org\/openurlref\/ OpenURLReferrer], which recognises and displays COinS markup. In fact there's also a version for IE at that URL, though I've not tried that.

327053 Hi. I didn't look for outside sources, just checked whatlinkshere of that article and saw he was mentioned at [[FC_Rapid_Bucure%C5%9Fti#Current_squad]]. Not sure if the football club article is correct, but a Google search do show some relation to the club official website.

265304 I would just copy the footnote syntax from the relevant pages on Wikipedia. There are code editors with \"snippet\" functionality and even Wiki markup support. Maybe you could configure some footnote snippets. Also, the avaible external Wikipedia editors might have the functionality to automatically insert footnotes, but I'm not sure about that. Have a look at this [[Wikipedia:Tools|page]]. &lt;strong&gt;

378117 Hi Sage, my proposal to give a \"Wikipedia in Secondary Education\" presentation to the [[New York State School Boards Association]] was accepted. I want to include a slide that overviews the rise in the value of annual Wikimedia Foundation budgets. I've found some values, but not all. Is there a one-stop place I can go to see this information? Even an annual revenue listing would be fine too. My current chart goes as far back as 2004, which is fine since order of magnitude from 2004 to 2011 is so different that include previous years would add minimal impact. Would be a great help! Thanks. '''

174258 I've tried searching for my answer but couldn't find it. Could someone let me know if it's possible to change the text color of a citation number within an article. The instance is question is on the [[Pittsburgh Pirates seasons]] page where the names\/nicknames are cited as they evolved. Is it possible\/advisable to change the purple citation number to white\/gray\/etc.? It's barely visible on the blue background. Thanks.

253248 Hmm, that's a good point. I don't know really, it was the closest I could find, but you're correct that it isn't really a franchise. I've placed it in [[:Category:Categories named after people]], so perhaps that could replace it. '''

603682 I've added a new suspected sock to [[Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations\/Backsllash]].

While that's a valid reason for speedy deletion in general, this page does not qualify for speedy deletion under that criterion because the image has not been tagged for seven days, and in any case the uploader claims to be the copyright holder and does not need to provide further evidence of that. If you still want the page to be deleted, please consider tagging it with a [[WP:CSD|speedy deletion template]] which does apply, [[Help:Redirect|redirecting]] it to another page, or using the [[WP:FFD]] process. Thanks!

442031 If you think that the article you created should remain separate, you may contest the deletion by adding &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;\/code&gt; to '''the top of [[:Ahmed Khatib|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion or \"db\" tag - if no such tag exists then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hangon tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Ahmed Khatib|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. Lastly, please note that if the page does get deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these admins]] to request that they  [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or have a copy emailed to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the [[WP:AFC|article creation process]] and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia.

506840 [[Image:Information_icon.svg|left]]Hello, this is a message from [[User:Android Mouse Bot 2|an automated bot]]. A tag has been placed on [[:Jerome Price]], by {{#ifeq:1|1|[[User:Sam42|Sam42]],}} another Wikipedia user, requesting that it be [[Wikipedia:Speedy deletions|speedily deleted]] from Wikipedia. The tag claims that it should be speedily deleted because [[:Jerome Price]] seems to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]]. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To contest the tagging and request that administrators wait before possibly deleting [[:Jerome Price]], please affix the template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{hangon}}&lt;\/nowiki&gt; to the page, and put a note on its talk page. If the article has already been deleted, see the advice and instructions at [[WP:WMD]]. '''Please note, this bot is only informing you of the nomination for speedy deletion, it did not nominate [[:Jerome Price]] itself.''' Feel free to leave a message on the [[User talk:Android Mouse|bot operator's talk page]] if you have any questions about this or any problems with this bot. --

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="step-3-extract-politeness-strategies-features">Step 3: Extract politeness strategies features</h2>
<p>Now we will extract the second type of pragmatic features described in the paper: politeness strategies. We can do this using convokit’s PolitenessStrategies class. This class does not require any training, so we can just apply it directly to the corpus.</p>

<h1>Step 5: Comparing features exhibited</h1>
<p>We can compare how often the pragmatic devices we extracted occur in the initial exchanges of conversations that turn awry, vs.&nbsp;conversations that stay on track. We will compute log-odds ratios of each device, comparing the awry and on-track conversations; we will also compute significance values from binomal tests comparing the proportion of awry-turning conversations exhibiting a particular device to the proportion of on-track conversations.</p>
<p>Since we’ve already got the pragmatic features precomputed, and our dataset of pairs compiled, it remains to compute the effect sizes and statistical significances, and plot these values, producing a plot like Figure 2 from the paper.</p>
<p>Note: due to changes in SpaCy’s dependency parsing that took place between the original time of publication and the updated release of this code, the extracted features may differ slightly from the ones used in the paper, so the resulting figure may differ slightly from the one in the paper.</p>
