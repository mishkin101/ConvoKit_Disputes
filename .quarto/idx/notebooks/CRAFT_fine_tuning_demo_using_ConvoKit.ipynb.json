Note that these low-level routines are largely taken from the [PyTorch seq2seq chatbot tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/chatbot_tutorial.html).\n\n## Part 2: load the data\n\nNow we load the labeled Wikiconv corpus from ConvoKit, and run some transformations to prepare it for use with PyTorch\n\nNow we can use the utilities defined in Part 1 to convert the ConvoKit conversational data into a tokenized form that can be straightforwardly turned into Tensors later.\n\n## Part 3: define the model\n\nNext, we need to set up the individual components of the CRAFT framework: the utterance encoder, the context encoder, and the classification head (since we are fine-tuning a pretrained model, we do not need to define the decoder here). Each component will be defined as a PyTorch `nn.Module`.\n\n## Part 4: define training loop\n\nNow that we have all the model components defined, we need to define the actual training procedure. This will be a fairly standard neural network training loop, iterating over batches of labeled dialogs and computing cross-entropy loss on the predicted label. We will also define evaluation functions so that we can compute accuracy on the validation set after every epoch, allowing us to keep the model with the best validation performance. Note that for the sake of simpler code, validation accuracy is computed in the \"unfair\" manner using a single run of CRAFT over the full context preceding the actual personal attack, rather than the more realistic (and complicated) iterated evaluation that is used for final evaluation of the test set (in practice the two metrics track each other fairly well, making this a reasonable simplification for the sake of easy validation).\n\n## Part 5: define the evaluation procedure\n\nWe're almost ready to run! The last component we need is some code to evaluate performance on the test set after fine-tuning is completed. This evaluation should use the full iterative procedure described in the paper, replicating how a system might be deployed in practice, without knowledge of where the personal attack occurs\n\n## Part 6: build and fine-tune the model\n\nWe finally have all the components we need! Now we can instantiate the CRAFT model components, load the pre-trained weights, and run fine-tuning.\n\n## Part 7: run test set evaluation\n\nNow that we have successfully fine-tuned the model, we run it on the test set so that we can evaluate performance.\n\n## Part 8: merge predictions back into corpus and evaluate\n\nNow that the hard part is done, all that is left to do is to evaluate the predictions. Since the predictions are in no particular order, we will first merge each prediction back into the source corpus, and then evaluate each conversation according to the order of utterances within that conversation.\n\n## Part 9: model analysis: how early is early warning?\n\nThe goal of CRAFT is to forecast outcomes in advance, but how far in advance does it typically make its prediction? Following the paper, we measure this in two ways: the number of *comments* between the first prediction and the actual derailment, and how much *elapsed time* that gap actually translates to.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":false,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"jupyter"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"CRAFT_fine_tuning_demo_using_ConvoKit.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
