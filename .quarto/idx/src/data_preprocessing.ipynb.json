The website clearly indicated the purchase was for Bryant’s jersey. Other sites were available but this was cheaper and offered quick delivery. When the jersey arrived, it was for a different player you never heard of. You request the correct jersey be sent.\n\n    The Seller responds: “The website clearly indicated this was for a Los Angeles Lakers jersey, not for a specific player. All sales are final.” You see they now removed mention of Kobe Bryant from their website but you know they are lying. To protect other customers, you post a negative review warning about the Seller’s deceptive behavior.\n\n    The Seller posted a negative review about you, calling you a “SMARTASS, SLANDERER and a FRAUD.” You have dozens of transactions on this site and have a near-spotless reputation. Now you worry others won’t sell to you.\n\n    volume_up\n    You (the Buyer): Upset but Determined\n    Your Demeanor: You're angry and frustrated, but you're also determined to get this resolved for your nephew and warn others.\n\n    Your Goals:\n\n    Get the Correct Jersey: You want the seller to send the Kobe Bryant jersey you originally purchased.\n    Clear Your Name: You want the seller's negative review removed and your reputation restored.\n    Warn Others: You want to make sure other potential buyers are aware of the seller's deceptive practices.\n    What You Know:\n\n    You have documented proof of your purchase, clearly showing it advertised a Kobe Bryant jersey.\n    You have screenshots of the website before they removed the Kobe Bryant reference.\n    You have a positive reputation on the website with many successful transactions.\n    What You Can Do:\n\n    Contact the Seller Again: State your case calmly but firmly. Remind them of the misleading advertisement and request the correct jersey be sent.\n    Report the Seller: Report the seller's deceptive practices and false advertising to the website's customer service department. Include your purchase proof and screenshots.\n    Respond to the Seller's Review: Write a public response to the seller's review on your profile. State the facts of the situation, provide evidence (if allowed by the website), and emphasize your positive purchase history.\n    Dispute the Review: If possible, file a dispute against the seller's review. Explain the situation and provide evidence to support your claim.\n    Here are some phrases you can use:\n\n    \"I am very disappointed with this purchase. The website clearly advertised a Kobe Bryant jersey, and that's what I paid for.\"\n    \"I am requesting that you send me the correct jersey as advertised.\"\n    \"I have documented proof that the website advertised a Kobe Bryant jersey at the time of purchase.\"\n    \"Your response and false advertising are unacceptable. I have reported your behavior to the website's customer service department.\"\n    \"The negative review you left on my profile is completely false and defamatory. My purchase history clearly shows my trustworthiness.\"\n    \"I am a loyal customer with a positive reputation on this website.

Think about reasons why these might be important to you. For each issue, write a sentence justifying why you deserve this.  Be speciffic!! You can later use these reasons when you negotiate.\n\n    volume_up\n    Issues for Negotiation:\n    1. Receiving the Correct Jersey:\n\n    Reasoning: This is the most important issue. My terminally ill nephew is a huge Kobe Bryant fan, and I specifically purchased the jersey for him based on the advertised description. Not receiving the correct jersey defeats the entire purpose of the purchase and causes emotional distress for my nephew during a difficult time.\n    2. Expedited Shipping:\n\n    Reasoning: Considering the situation with my nephew, receiving the correct jersey as quickly as possible is crucial. Since the seller is at fault for the mistake, they should be responsible for any expedited shipping costs to ensure my nephew can enjoy the jersey before it's too late.\n    3. Partial Refund:\n\n    Reasoning: The website advertised a specific product (Kobe Bryant jersey) at a specific price. Due to the seller's deceptive practices, I was not given the product I paid for. A partial refund would acknowledge the inconvenience and wasted time caused by this situation.\n    4. Seller Review Removal:\n\n    Reasoning: The seller's negative review (\"SMARTASS, SLANDERER and a FRAUD\") is completely false and tarnishes my reputation on the website. Its removal is essential to restore my good standing and ensure other sellers are willing to do business with me.\n    5. Public Apology from Seller:\n\n    Reasoning: The seller's deceptive advertising and false review not only hurt me but potentially misled other customers. A public apology would acknowledge their wrongdoing and deter them from similar behavior in the future.\n    Remember: While all these issues are important, prioritize getting the Kobe Bryant jersey for your nephew as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\n\n    share\n\n\n    more_vert\n\n    Receive a refund: You could demand a full or partial refund for the price of the item. Why might this be important to you? (1 sentence)\n\n    volume_up\n    A full refund wouldn't be necessary if I receive the Kobe jersey, but a partial refund would be important to compensate for the time wasted and potential additional costs (expedited shipping) caused by the seller's mistake.\n\n\n\n\n    share\n\n\n    more_vert\n\n    Keep your negative review of Seller: The Seller might demand you take down your negative review. Why might you want to keep it up on the site? (1 sentence)\n\n    volume_up\n    Keeping my negative review up is important to warn other potential buyers about the seller's deceptive advertising and false claims that could negatively impact their purchases.\n\n\n\n\n    share\n\n\n    more_vert\n\n    Seller removes negative review of you: You could demand the Seller remove the bad review they made about you. Why might this be important to you? (1 sentence)\n\n    volume_up\n    Getting the seller's negative review removed is crucial because it's demonstrably false and harms my reputation on the website, potentially causing other sellers to hesitate to do business with me.\n\n\n\n\n    share\n\n\n    more_vert\n    expand_more\n    Receive formal apology: You could demand Seller update their bad review of you with an apology clarifying that they made a mistake and apologize for how they initially responded. Why might this be important to you? (1 sentence)\n\n    volume_up\n    A formal apology from the seller publicly acknowledges their wrongdoing, clears my name, and deters them from future deceptive practices that could harm other buyers.\n\n\n\n\n    share\n\n\n    more_vert\n    expand_more\n    On the next page, you will be matched with someone playing the other role in this dispute.

Explain the situation and provide evidence to support your claim.\n    Here are some phrases you can use:\n\n    \"I am very disappointed with this purchase. The website clearly advertised a Kobe Bryant jersey, and that's what I paid for.\"\n    \"I am requesting that you send me the correct jersey as advertised.\"\n    \"I have documented proof that the website advertised a Kobe Bryant jersey at the time of purchase.\"\n    \"Your response and false advertising are unacceptable.

Think about reasons why these might be important to you. For each issue, write a sentence justifying why you deserve this.  Be speciffic!! You can later use these reasons when you negotiate.\n\n    volume_up\n    Issues for Negotiation:\n    1. Receiving the Correct Jersey:\n\n    Reasoning: This is the most important issue. My terminally ill nephew is a huge Kobe Bryant fan, and I specifically purchased the jersey for him based on the advertised description. Not receiving the correct jersey defeats the entire purpose of the purchase and causes emotional distress for my nephew during a difficult time.\n    2. Expedited Shipping:\n\n    Reasoning: Considering the situation with my nephew, receiving the correct jersey as quickly as possible is crucial. Since the seller is at fault for the mistake, they should be responsible for any expedited shipping costs to ensure my nephew can enjoy the jersey before it's too late.\n    3. Partial Refund:\n\n    Reasoning: The website advertised a specific product (Kobe Bryant jersey) at a specific price. Due to the seller's deceptive practices, I was not given the product I paid for. A partial refund would acknowledge the inconvenience and wasted time caused by this situation.\n    4. Seller Review Removal:\n\n    Reasoning: The seller's negative review (\"SMARTASS, SLANDERER and a FRAUD\") is completely false and tarnishes my reputation on the website. Its removal is essential to restore my good standing and ensure other sellers are willing to do business with me.\n    5. Public Apology from Seller:\n\n    Reasoning: The seller's deceptive advertising and false review not only hurt me but potentially misled other customers. A public apology would acknowledge their wrongdoing and deter them from similar behavior in the future.\n    Remember: While all these issues are important, prioritize getting the Kobe Bryant jersey for your nephew as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\n\n    share\n\n\n    more_vert\n\n    Receive a refund: You could demand a full or partial refund for the price of the item. Why might this be important to you? (1 sentence)\n\n    volume_up\n    A full refund wouldn't be necessary if I receive the Kobe jersey, but a partial refund would be important to compensate for the time wasted and potential additional costs (expedited shipping) caused by the seller's mistake.\n\n\n\n\n    share\n\n\n    more_vert\n\n    Keep your negative review of Seller: The Seller might demand you take down your negative review. Why might you want to keep it up on the site? (1 sentence)\n\n    volume_up\n    Keeping my negative review up is important to warn other potential buyers about the seller's deceptive advertising and false claims that could negatively impact their purchases.\n\n\n\n\n    share\n\n\n    more_vert\n\n    Seller removes negative review of you: You could demand the Seller remove the bad review they made about you. Why might this be important to you? (1 sentence)\n\n    volume_up\n    Getting the seller's negative review removed is crucial because it's demonstrably false and harms my reputation on the website, potentially causing other sellers to hesitate to do business with me.\n\n\n\n\n    share\n\n\n    more_vert\n    expand_more\n    Receive formal apology: You could demand Seller update their bad review of you with an apology clarifying that they made a mistake and apologize for how they initially responded. Why might this be important to you? (1 sentence)\n\n    volume_up\n    A formal apology from the seller publicly acknowledges their wrongdoing, clears my name, and deters them from future deceptive practices that could harm other buyers.\n\n\n\n\n    share\n\n\n    more_vert\n    expand_more\n    On the next page, you will be matched with someone playing the other role in this dispute.
